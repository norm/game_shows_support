1
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,666
LEONARDO: Ezio! Here, over here!

2
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,699
LEONARDO: Ezio! Here, over here!

3
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,333
LEONARDO: Ezio! Here, over here!

4
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,733
LEONARDO: Ezio! Here, over here!

5
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,766
Thank you, Ezio. You saved my life.

6
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:18,300
EZIO: I did what had to be done, you would have done the same.

7
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,333
I doubt it, bravery is not my strong suit.

8
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,933
I owe you a debt, brother.

9
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,366
EZIO: Di niente (It's nothing).

10
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:29,066
CAPTAIN: Tutti a bordo! Fra poco si salpa!
(All aboard! We're leaving soon!)

11
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,533
That's our traghetto (ferry), Venezia awaits.

12
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,066
CAPTAIN: Where's your pass?

13
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,733
EZIO: What pass?

14
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,299
LEONARDO: You don't have a pass?

15
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,000
CAPTAIN: You cannot enter Venezia without a pass.

16
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,399
CAPTAIN: Who invited you?

17
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,066
EZIO: Uh, nobody.

18
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,799
CAPTAIN: Basta (Stop)! No pass, no entrance.

19
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:51,166
EZIO: Don't worry Leonardo, I will come up with something.

20
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,200
WOMAN: Don't just stand there, I need help!

21
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,000
WOMAN: Aiuto! Qualcuno mi faccia scendere da quest' affare! Aiutatemi!
(Help! Someone get me off this thing! Help me!)

22
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,000
WOMAN: Dio del Cielo! Aiutatemi! (For Christ's sake! Help me!)

23
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:50,000
WOMAN: Aiuto! Qualcuno mi faccia scendere da quest' affare! Aiutatemi!
(Help! Someone get me off this thing! Help me!)

24
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,366
Madonna.

25
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,033
Oh, you are good, the ladies must like you.

26
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:18,533
EZIO: I wasn't looking to impress, only to help someone in distress.

27
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,733
WOMAN: Which is exactly why you impress.

28
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,266
WOMAN: And you are Messer…?

29
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:28,433
Auditore. But please, call me Ezio.

30
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,066
I'm Caterina.

31
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:37,033
CATERINA: Now, Ezio, we must find you suitable reward.

32
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:40,233
CATERINA: Do you have any suggestions?

33
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:43,066
EZIO: There is perhaps something you could help me with.

34
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,500
CATERINA: I'm all ears.

35
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:54,466
Yes Signora, whatever you say, Signora.

36
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,533
He won't trouble you any more.

37
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,566
I … took care of it.

38
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:05,933
Thank you, Caterina.

39
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,933
CATERINA: Perhaps we'll see each other again.

40
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:15,500
Should you ever find yourself in the city of Forlì,
it would be my … pleasure to welcome you.

41
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,899
I look forward to enjoying your hospitality.

42
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:27,166
CAPTAIN: Please accept my most humble apologies, Messere.

43
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,200
CAPTAIN: Had I known…

44
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,166
EZIO: It's quite alright, my friend.

45
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,266
LEONARDO: Be careful, Ezio. Do you know who that was?

46
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,166
EZIO: My next conquest.

47
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,633
LEONARDO: I don't think so, Ezio.

48
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:04,033
LEONARDO: That's Caterina Sforza,
daughter of the Duca di Milano. Her husband is—

49
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,299
EZIO: Husband?
LEONARDO: Si!

50
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,466
Her husband is the lord of Forlì.

51
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:11,899
That woman is as powerful and dangerous as she is young and beautiful.

52
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,233
EZIO: Sembra come una donna per me
(Sounds like my kind of lady).

53
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,333
DESMOND: Everything alright?

54
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,466
LUCY: Better than alright. You're making amazing progress.

55
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,533
SHAUN: "Amazing" is quite a strong word.

56
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,266
DESMOND: Then why are we stopping?

57
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:36,266
REBECCA: Prolonged exposure to the Animus can have … uh … side effects.

58
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,466
DESMOND: Huh, awesome!

59
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,233
LUCY: It's nothing to worry about.

60
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,333
You haven't shown any of the symptoms.

61
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,799
Symptoms? What symptoms?

62
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:50,833
REBECCA: Degradation of cognition, temporal hallucinations,
multiple awareness issues, overlapping realities, you know.

63
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,200
DESMOND: So what you're saying is…?

64
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,866
SHAUN: What we're saying, Desmond, is if you're not careful,
you may not need the animus to visit with your ancestors.

65
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,133
SHAUN: Which wouldn't be a bad thing, assuming you could control it.

66
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,799
SHAUN: Up until now, though, no-one has.

67
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,433
DESMOND: Subject 16.

68
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,466
LUCY: We have safeguards, Desmond.

69
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:12,633
LUCY: And they kept him in the Animus for way too long,
sometimes days at a time.

70
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,000
LUCY: We're being careful with you.

71
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,433
DESMOND: I hope so.

72
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:18,766
LUCY: Anyway, I was hoping we could test out your skill retention.

73
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,733
LUCY: See if you've picked up some of Ezio's abilities.

74
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,666
DESMOND: I'm game.

75
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,533
LUCY: Great. Meet me downstairs when you're ready.

76
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,166
DESMOND: What are you up to?

77
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
What am I—who are you, my mum?

78
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:40,533
I've been running traces on the Codex pages,
looking to see if any of them are still around.

79
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,066
And?

80
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,533
SHAUN: Nothing concrete.

81
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:46,966
Reports of one in the archives of the National Central Library in Florence.

82
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:51,566
SHAUN: Maybe a few in the hands of collectors, probably Templars.

83
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:55,000
I'd send someone to check it out, but we're very short on manpower.

84
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,466
How do you think the Codex wound up in Italy?

85
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,399
I mean, it seems so random.

86
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,233
Dante Alighieri by way of Marco Polo.

87
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,266
Seriously?

88
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:06,266
Something happened in 1321, yeah?

89
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:13,966
Now, I'm still working on making the connections, but from what I can tell,
Polo encountered the assassins while visiting Kublai Khan.

90
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,366
That's right, this must be when he obtained the Codex.

91
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:21,100
Now, when he returned to Italy, he passed it on to Dante.

92
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,966
Dante was close to him, if not an Assassin himself.

93
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,000
Now, I have no idea what brought the two of them together.

94
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,600
But I'll tell you what, I reckon we could find out.

95
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,533
DESMOND: I don't think Lucy wants us messing with the Animus.

96
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,933
Yeah, you're right, we've got enough to deal with.

97
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,299
I guess satisfying my curiosity will have to wait.

98
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,733
What could 16 have found that needs so much secrecy and security?

99
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,333
Oh , I don't know, do I?

100
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,000
Lucy thinks it's something about the Codex, but I'm not so sure.

101
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,133
I'm all ears if it's as life changing as 16 says.

102
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,633
Blimey, if I was allowed to use the Animus, I'd be the one in there finding out!

103
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:00,966
Instead, as usual, I'm forced to sit here on the sidelines.

104
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,366
DESMOND: How'd you get mixed up in all this?

105
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:07,799
Most Assassins, Desmond, are like you, yeah?

106
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,866
SHAUN: They're born into the Brotherhood.

107
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,466
Not me, though.

108
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,233
REBECCA: Ugh, here we go.

109
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,033
SHAUN: What?! He asked!

110
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:18,200
SHAUN: Anyway, I've always been a big fan of the unexplained.

111
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,233
SHAUN: There's something exciting there, you know?

112
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:25,033
A sense that life is more interesting, more mysterious
than we've been raised to believe.

113
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,666
DESMOND: So what, you just stumbled across the Assassins?

114
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,899
No, I found the Templars first, actually.

115
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,966
Abstergo is a big company.

116
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,600
It's too big, which means there were slipups.

117
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,433
You know, like that mess having right now with the flouride.

118
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:41,133
Only I was tracking this stuff years ago.

119
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,500
I must have been, what, 14? 15?

120
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,833
You knew Abstergo was a Templar company?

121
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,733
SHAUN: No, not at first.

122
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:52,666
I just knew they were up to no good,
and I figured maybe I could do something about it.

123
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,433
So I started digging up everything I could on the company.

124
00:15:55,433 --> 00:16:01,133
Posting stuff to newsgroups, trying to spread the word,
looking for people who might have stories to tell.

125
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,933
You must have gotten Abstergo's attention.

126
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,733
Well, fortunately, I got Rebecca's first.

127
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,899
SHAUN: Otherwise, I'd probably be the bottom of a river.

128
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,066
REBECCA: You're welcome.

129
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,899
SHAUN: Yep, she tried to warn me.

130
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,899
SHAUN: Told me I was messing with the wrong kind of people.

131
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,399
REBECCA: And what did you do?

132
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,700
I thought you were mental.

133
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,833
REBECCA: But now you know better.

134
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,100
Yep, now I know you're just a bit mental.

135
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,566
Long story short, I saved his ass multiple times.

136
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,966
REBECCA: Should have dropped him and let Abstergo have their way.

137
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,266
Listen to you trying to be all badass.

138
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:30,733
So what happened?

139
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,299
I have a gift, Desmond.

140
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,600
I have a gift for seeing things, making connections.

141
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,766
Like your eagle vision, you know, only useful.

142
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,533
REBECCA: We offered him a place with us.

143
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,233
SHAUN: Yes you did, yeah. The alternative?

144
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,833
A life on the run from the most powerful organisation on the planet.

145
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,033
I decided to prolong my life, I'm eccentric like that.

146
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,433
So I signed up.

147
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:53,799
I've been doing research and analysis for them ever since.

148
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,566
Best part is: I love it.

149
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,066
SHAUN: I'm keeping tabs on the other teams.

150
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,133
DESMOND: Other teams?

151
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:05,133
SHAUN: The Templars have been hunting down the pieces of Eden
using the map they got from you at Abstergo.

152
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,000
SHAUN: Luckily, Lucy has provided us with a copy as well,
allowing us to pursue them.

153
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,433
DESMOND: And how's that working out?

154
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,099
SHAUN: So far, so good.

155
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,333
DESMOND: If they find even one of those pieces we're gonna have problems.

156
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,933
SHAUN: Oh, you're picking up on that, are you?

157
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,700
SHAUN: That is why we're training you.

158
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,866
SHAUN: Once you've acquired the necessary skills,
we'll be able to send you into the field.

159
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,900
DESMOND: And what about you? Why aren't you out there?

160
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,266
SHAUN: I'm not out there 'cause my expertise lies in other areas.

161
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,266
SHAUN: And to be honest, I prefer it that way.

162
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:35,633
SHAUN: But make no mistake, Desmond, I'm an assassin through and through.

163
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,366
SHAUN: I've killed before.

164
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,500
SHAUN: I expect to kill again.

165
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,799
SHAUN: It's just that I prefer not to.

166
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,533
Hey, Nice work today, you're a natural. 

167
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,466
Thanks! It's definitely getting easier.

168
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,400
I got to say, after all the crap I went through at Abstergo,
it's nice to be with the good guys.

169
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,200
SHAUN: "Good guys"? Let's not get carried away.

170
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,066
What's that supposed to mean?

171
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,500
In case you've forgotten Rebecca, we're Assassins.

172
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
I could look it up for you, if you like.

173
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,799
Basically, it means we assassinate people.

174
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,266
Only when we have to.

175
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,400
SHAUN: It's a choice — you're choosing to kill.

176
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,900
I haven't killed anyone.

177
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,266
No, not yet, but what do you think all this is for, eh?

178
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:31,400
You think Lucy is giving you Ezio's abilities so you can
build schools in South America and deliver rice to starving Indonesians?

179
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,933
What are you, Desmond, a vegan?

180
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,566
You'd be the first vegan Assassin in history.

181
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:39,933
Look, it's not ideal, and taking a life is never easy.

182
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,633
But sometimes there's no other way.

183
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,966
REBECCA: Sometimes, Desmond, people have to die for things to change.

184
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,966
SHAUN: She's got a point, but don't fool yourself into thinking you have no say.

185
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:54,466
I mean, isn't that what we're all about here? Safeguarding free will?

186
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,133
REBECCA: Sorry, I didn't mean to make it into a whole big thing.

187
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,166
Ah, it's cool. So how is she treating you?

188
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,700
The translation software is still a bit laggy.

189
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,799
You're probably catching the odd bit of Italian, sorry about that.

190
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,866
No worries, Abstergo's machine wasn't perfect either.

191
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,833
So what's the plan?

192
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,433
We're going to see what you've managed to retain.

193
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,200
Come on!

194
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
LUCY: Abstergo's out there looking for us.

195
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,066
They're better funded and better equipped,
so it's only a matter of time before they find this place.

196
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,433
We need to be ready for them when they do.

197
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,433
LUCY: I want you to activate the warehouse's defence system.

198
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
LUCY: I'll let you figure out how to reach the sensors.

199
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,233
DESMOND: Oh, come on, not even a hint?

200
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,966
LUCY: Open your eyes, Desmond.

201
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,866
DESMOND: Uh, Lucy, I'm seeing things.

202
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,599
LUCY: Do the hallucinations last longer than 30 seconds?

203
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,400
DESMOND: No.

204
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,900
LUCY: Then it's nothing to be worried about, it'll pass.

205
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:39,033
DESMOND: So, how am I doing?

206
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,299
LUCY: You've picked up every single one of Ezio's skills.

207
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,900
LUCY: The adoption rate is fantastic.

208
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,000
LUCY: Another day or two and we'll be done.

209
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,333
DESMOND: Alright, you gotta tell me. Why Ezio, why Italy?

210
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:28,000
DESMOND: I mean, we could have just gone back to Altaïr again,
followed him during his early years.

211
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,900
LUCY: It started with 16.

212
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,299
DESMOND: Ah, good old Subject 16.

213
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,933
DESMOND: He repainted my room, you know. With his blood!

214
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,533
LUCY: I've been going through his files.

215
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:41,233
LUCY: Vidic flagged a couple of his Animus sessions.

216
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:44,900
LUCY: A bunch of different ancestors, different dates and locations…

217
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,033
LUCY: Ancient Africa, the Middle East…

218
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,700
LUCY: But towards the end, he became obsessed with Italy.

219
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,633
LUCY: I think he knew about the vault.

220
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,633
LUCY: A few of the records of his later Animus sessions are missing.

221
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
LUCY: And the sessions that are there…

222
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,200
LUCY: After everything the Templars put him through…

223
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,833
LUCY: After everything I put him through, it's all scrambled.

224
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,200
LUCY: If we hadn't pushed 16 so hard, we'd have the answers already.

225
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
LUCY: And maybe he'd still be alive.

226
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,366
DESMOND: So you're after the Codex and the vault.

227
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,133
LUCY: I knew you had an ancestor in Italy who was at the centre of all of this.

228
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,366
LUCY: Alright, I think we're done for the day.

229
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,133
You should get some rest.

230
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,233
Lucy, what happened to 16 wasn't your fault.

231
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,799
You were just as much a prisoner as I was.

232
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:42,933
Thanks.

233
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,633
Good night, Desmond.

234
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,366
I'm glad you're here.

235
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:06,033
DESMOND: What the hell?

236
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,033
What is this?

237
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,233
Where am I?

238
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,233
It's Acre.

239
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:15,866
Altaïr.

240
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,900
How the hell?

241
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,133
I'm not even in the Animus.

242
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,433
I must have passed out.

243
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,566
Just having some kind of weird dream.

244
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,366
Going without sleep for who knows how long.

245
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,566
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

246
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:56,566
Hmm, that must be his target.

247
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,400
It's the woman from Acre.

248
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,066
What was her name?

249
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,266
Maria, yeah.

250
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,533
I wonder what he wants with her?

251
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:25,433
Whoa, alright, wasn't expecting that.

252
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,500
Wait a second, why aren't I following Altaïr?

253
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,599
I'm stuck here with Maria?

254
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,066
Oh, shit.

255
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,033
That must mean…

256
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,433
This is one weird dream.

257
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,933
REBECCA: Sorry to barge in on you like this, but it's getting late, and we were—

258
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,433
REBECCA: Hey, you okay?

259
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,166
DESMOND: Uh, yeah, yeah, all good.

260
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,900
DESMOND: Weird dreams, that's all.

261
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,099
REBECCA: Alright, I'll let you get ready. See you in a few.

262
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,733
SHAUN: Ah! Good of you to join us.

263
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:32,400
DESMOND: Sorry, long night.

264
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,033
SHAUN: What a professional. What a professional approach.

265
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,266
REBECCA: Leave him alone.

266
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,733
Well, you'll forgive me if I want to get some actual work done.

267
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,133
Ooh, madness, isn't it?

268
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,533
LUCY: Sean! Please, that's enough.

269
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:44,933
SHAUN: Alright.

270
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,166
DESMOND: Hey.
LUCY: [clears throat] Uh, hi.

271
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,000
You okay?

272
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,299
LUCY: Yeah, I'm fine.

273
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,333
Everything's fine.

274
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,500
DESMOND: You sure?

275
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:58,233
We lost two more teams last night.

276
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
That's eight more of us, just…

277
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,000
…gone.

278
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:04,133
DESMOND: I'm sorry.

279
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,066
I don't know what to do anymore.

280
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,799
It just keeps getting worse and worse.

281
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:13,233
Hey, remember what you told me? You gotta have faith.

282
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,633
DESMOND: And look, here we are safe and sound.

283
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:18,566
LUCY: Ha ha ha! For how long?

284
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,733
LUCY: And when they find us? Then what?

285
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:24,666
DESMOND: When that happens, if that happens, we'll deal with it.

286
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,366
DESMOND: I'll keep you safe.

287
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,066
LUCY: Anyway, enough with my little breakdown.

288
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,866
I should get back to work.

289
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,366
And so should you.

290
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,233
ALVISE: Messer da Vinci?

291
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,233
Yes?

292
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:14,333
Buongiorno e ben arrivato! I'm Alvise.

293
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,066
Il Signor Dona has asked that I escort you to the workshop.

294
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,266
Are you ready?

295
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,233
ALVISE: Ah, Venezia!

296
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:31,799
ALVISE: What other place is as beauiful, as stable, as perfect?

297
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,566
ALVISE: Come, I will show you her wonders.

298
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,900
ALVISE: Our first stop, the Rialto bridge.

299
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,333
ALVISE: Behold the elegance with which she spans the Grand Canal.

300
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,299
ALVISE: A symbol of Venetian unity and pride.

301
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,766
ALVISE: Let us continue.

302
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,866
ALVISE: Here we are, San Giacomo di Rialto.

303
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:59,166
ALVISE: Oldest church in Venezia. Isn't she beautiful?

304
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,666
ALVISE: And her clock tower? Magnifico!

305
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,566
ALVISE: Come, come, there's more to see.

306
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:24,099
ALVISE: No other city can match the size of Venezia's markets.

307
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:27,433
ALVISE: Be it spices or silk from near and far.

308
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:28,700
ALVISE: There is…

309
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,299
ALVISE: There is…

310
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:33,266
GUARD: You were told to stay home!

311
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:37,033
MERCHANT: But the rent is paid, I have every right to sell here.

312
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:39,200
GUARD: Emilio disagrees!

313
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,933
MERCHANT: No! Stop, stop!

314
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,200
ALVISE: Let us continue the tour… elsewhere.

315
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,000
Look, isn't it amazing?

316
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:09,199
Would you mind buying it for me? I, er, I left my money with my bags.

317
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,699
EZIO: Hey! Mind your step coglione (jerk)!

318
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,433
ALVISE: And here we have the Palazzo della Seta, home to Emilio Barbarigo.

319
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:39,233
ALVISE: Normally, I'd suggest a closer look, but the way things are now…

320
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,833
EZIO: Why, what's happened?

321
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:44,199
ALVISE: He is attempting to unify the merchants beneath a single banner.

322
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:47,699
ALVISE: There has been resistance, some of it violent.

323
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,766
EZIO: What kind of resistance?

324
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:51,866
ALVISE: They say they're fighting for the people.

325
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:54,366
ALVISE: For freedom or some such nonsense.

326
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,066
ALVISE: Baggianate (Nonsense), if you ask me.

327
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:04,366
They destroyed my stand, I demand compensation.

328
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,366
GUARD: Here you are, then.

329
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,833
MERCHANT: The Doge will know about this!

330
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,800
MERCHANT: I'll report you to the council!

331
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:14,066
GUARD 2: Good luck with that, my friend.

332
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,866
MERCHANT: What are you doing?

333
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,933
GUARD 3: You're under arrest for disrupting commerce.

334
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:23,933
MERCHANT: What? You just invented that! There's no such law.

335
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,300
GUARD 3: There is now.

336
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,066
MERCHANT: No! Stop!

337
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:51,599
And now I present to you your workshop, Ser da Vinci!

338
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,333
ALVISE: We spared no expense in its design.

339
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:58,766
You will see it is perfect, as if you never left Firenze.

340
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:04,333
I wish you great success and hope you enjoy Venezia
as much as she enjoys having you.

341
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,266
So here we are. Exciting isn't it?

342
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,633
Care to come in?

343
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:19,866
EZIO: Maybe later, I need to visit the Palazzo della Seta,
try and gain an audience with Emilio.

344
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:27,233
As you wish, but should you find yourself with free time,
or another Codex page, don't hesitate to visit.

345
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,133
My door is always open.

346
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,800
EZIO: Grazie, my friend.

347
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,599
Di nulla (It's nothing).

348
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:57,033
REBECCA: I found this awesome place for you to explore and practise your skills.

349
00:36:57,033 --> 00:37:00,333
REBECCA: Santa Maria dei Frari. I've marked it on your map.

350
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,766
EZIO: How best to get inside?

351
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:45,300
EZIO: Scale the wall and … oh, that's not good.

352
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,599
EZIO: I'll never make that jump, I need to find another way.

353
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:16,833
EZIO: Hey, I remember you.
WOMAN: I need your help.

354
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,699
We need to go!

355
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:21,000
EZIO: You'll never did apologise for knocking me over.

356
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,633
NOW!

357
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,500
EZIO: Va bene. Where to?

358
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,566
The water!

359
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:27,699
EZIO: That doesn't exactly narrow it down!

360
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,666
WOMAN: Alright you bastards, who wants to die first?

361
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,599
WOMAN: Goddamn archers!

362
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,500
WOMAN: Quickly, they're getting closer!

363
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,666
WOMAN: Come any closer and I'll cut you to pieces!

364
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,533
WOMAN: What are you doing? Hurry up!

365
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:30,666
Yeah.

366
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:35,699
WOMAN: Aah! Cristo! My leg!

367
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,366
EZIO: Can you walk?

368
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,833
WOMAN: What do you think?

369
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,099
EZIO: I never did catch your name.

370
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,000
WOMAN: Rosa.

371
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,766
EZIO: Onorato Rosa, I'm Ezio.

372
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:54,833
ROSA: I know.

373
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,366
EZIO: What do you mean "I know"?

374
00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:03,166
ROSA: Non ora (Not now). Now is not the time for small talk. Are you blind?

375
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,400
ROSA: Ugo!

376
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,300
What's this?

377
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,800
EZIO: Rosa's been wounded.

378
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,066
UGO: Pass her here, we'll go the rest of the way in the boat.

379
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,366
Careful.

380
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:52,900
Go! I'll deal with the guards.

381
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:35,566
He's dead, idiota!

382
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:38,300
Say a prayer later.

383
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,599
UGO: Porco demonio (Goddamnit)!
ROSA: I need to see…

384
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:43,800
I need to see Antonio, aaaaaa!

385
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:47,933
EZIO: Be careful! Let me do it. Go and find Antonio.

386
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:49,866
ROSA: Ugo, do what he says!

387
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:52,699
UGO: Qua l'ultimo arrivato da gli ordini!
(I can't believe I'm taking orders from this guy!)

388
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:56,633
ROSA: So tired.

389
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,033
EZIO: Hey! Wake up!

390
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,933
EZIO: We need help!

391
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:17,033
UGO: Where's Antonio?

392
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:20,166
UGO: Make yourselves useful! Clear a space for her.

393
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:22,366
UGO: Put her down there.

394
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,433
Where are we?

395
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:29,866
Home. They've sent for help.

396
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:31,166
Thank you.

397
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,033
Rosa! What's happened?

398
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:35,066
Just get this out of me.

399
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:37,900
Soon, soon, let's have a look first.

400
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,266
Clean entry and exit through the thigh, that's good.

401
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:41,699
Get it out!

402
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:42,599
Rosa, we must take care not to—

403
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,000
NOW!

404
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,633
Come vuoi (As you wish).

405
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:46,766
Tenetela (Hold it)!

406
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:55,333
ANTONIO: I'm sorry, piccola (sweetheart).

407
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:58,266
Sorry?! Ficcatelo nel culo your "sorry"!
(Shove your "sorry" up your ass!)

408
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,266
ANTONIO: Go fetch Bianca, and be quick!

409
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,333
ANTONIO: Help me with this.

410
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:01,766
EZIO: How?

411
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:03,300
ANTONIO: Take a clean piece of linen.

412
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,699
When I remove my hand, press the cloth into her wound.

413
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,633
ANTONIO: Are you ready? Now!

414
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:15,266
ANTONIO: Ben fatto, you work well under pressure

415
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:17,900
ANTONIO: She's spirited, this one.

416
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,900
ROSA: Porca puttana (son of a bitch)!
ANTONIO: Avanti (Come on)!

417
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:22,766
Get Rosa inside so that Bianca can close the wound.

418
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,733
You'll be alright, the worst is past.

419
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:29,599
ROSA: Ti venisse il cancro, brutto bastardo!
(I hope you catch plague, you ugly bastard!)

420
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,099
ROSA: A te e quella grandissima troia di tua madre!
(You and your whore mother!)

421
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,866
ANTONIO: Rosa is most dear to me. If I had lost her…

422
00:51:35,866 --> 00:51:38,933
EZIO: I've always had a soft spot for women in distress.

423
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:40,266
ANTONIO: So I've heard.

424
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:45,266
Don't look so surprised, we know all about you Ser Ezio.

425
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:47,333
ANTONIO: Your work in Florence and the rest of Tuscany.

426
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:51,433
Good work too, if a little … unrefined.

427
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:52,800
EZIO: Then you know why I'm in Venezia?

428
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,133
ANTONIO: I can guess.

429
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:57,766
When you have a minute, come see me in my office.

430
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:59,766
There's something we should discuss.

431
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:18,133
ANTONIO: Ezio, prego (welcome).

432
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:21,966
ANTONIO: Can I offer you something? Biscotti? Un caffè? 

433
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,233
What's caffè?

434
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:26,366
An interesting concoction brought to me by a Turk merchant.

435
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,766
Here, have a taste.

436
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,666
A little bitter if you ask me.

437
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,900
Just seems lacking somehow.

438
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:41,633
I don't know, have you considered adding sugar maybe, or latte?

439
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:44,466
I suppose it's something of an acquired taste.

440
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,966
Enough about that. Now, where were we?

441
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:53,266
Our failure at the Palazzo cost us dearly.

442
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:55,833
It will take time to recover.

443
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,933
No doubt Emilio will use this pause to strengthen his defences.

444
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:02,833
And continue his oppression of the district.

445
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:06,666
You may not share our motive, but I know you share our goal.

446
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,833
Why not gather your forces and try again?

447
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,966
To act in haste would only bring more losses.

448
00:53:11,966 --> 00:53:16,000
No, we must resupply and draw new plans.

449
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,066
I can ill afford to sit around and wait.

450
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:21,066
Nor would I want you to.

451
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:22,633
Work with us instead.

452
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,066
Already my men begin to mend today's wounds.

453
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:27,466
Seek them out, they'll put you to work.

454
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:32,366
The sooner you aid them, the sooner we can strike.

455
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:36,566
Molto bene, Messere (Very well, sir). I accept.

456
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,266
It is the right decision.
