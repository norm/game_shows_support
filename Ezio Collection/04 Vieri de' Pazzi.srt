1
0:00:06,540 --> 0:00:07,120
Yeah,

2
0:00:22,039 --> 0:00:22,620
yeah,

3
0:00:32,039 --> 0:00:32,600
yeah,

4
0:01:04,750 --> 0:01:05,738
it's you.

5
0:01:05,739 --> 0:01:07,218
What are you doing here?

6
0:01:07,219 --> 0:01:09,149
Taking responsibility.

7
0:01:09,150 --> 0:01:11,269
Yeah, He troubles you because of me.

8
0:01:12,040 --> 0:01:16,149
Very troubles us because he's a Templar and we are assassins.

9
0:01:16,150 --> 0:01:18,650
Either way, I wish to help.

10
0:01:18,939 --> 0:01:20,039
Bye, Benny.

11
0:01:20,040 --> 0:01:22,318
Listen close First.

12
0:01:22,319 --> 0:01:27,150
We must find a way inside the city, though it seems very expects us.

13
0:01:27,239 --> 0:01:30,849
He has sealed the gates and sent his men to guard them.

14
0:01:31,099 --> 0:01:34,198
Fortunately for us, the city is larger than his host.

15
0:01:34,200 --> 0:01:35,838
The Southern Gate suffers for it.

16
0:01:35,840 --> 0:01:37,670
So this is where we'll strike.

17
0:01:55,359 --> 0:01:58,150
All right, here's how it is going to work.

18
0:01:58,150 --> 0:02:01,908
My men and I will distract the guards once we have engaged them.

19
0:02:01,909 --> 0:02:05,399
Get yourself over the wall and find a way to open the gates.

20
0:02:05,400 --> 0:02:07,098
Take these throwing knives.

21
0:02:07,099 --> 0:02:09,500
Used them to dispatch the archers.

22
0:02:09,789 --> 0:02:11,449
I'm ready when you are.

23
0:02:11,629 --> 0:02:13,250
Then let us begin.

24
0:02:14,789 --> 0:02:16,750
I'll a taco.

25
0:03:01,139 --> 0:03:01,699
No,

26
0:03:13,240 --> 0:03:13,900
but

27
0:03:14,840 --> 0:03:15,439
okay.

28
0:03:32,639 --> 0:03:33,199
Yeah,

29
0:03:41,639 --> 0:03:42,149
Well done.

30
0:03:42,150 --> 0:03:43,750
That's you were in

31
0:03:45,439 --> 0:03:46,750
this way, men.

32
0:03:55,780 --> 0:03:59,840
I want you to distract those gods and keep them from raising the alarm.

33
0:03:59,840 --> 0:04:03,069
Hopefully buy me enough time to find and silence.

34
0:04:03,520 --> 0:04:05,310
Wait.

35
0:04:05,900 --> 0:04:09,050
Take a few of my men with you just to be safe.

36
0:04:09,150 --> 0:04:11,439
Come join me once they've dealt with.

37
0:04:12,969 --> 0:04:13,909
Now.

38
0:04:14,490 --> 0:04:17,550
No one knows, but something has him on age.

39
0:04:17,589 --> 0:04:19,849
How else to explain all the battles, Cee?

40
0:04:19,850 --> 0:04:21,209
Mail again when you should follow.

41
0:04:21,209 --> 0:04:23,269
Instead, he's turned this into a nurse Mains.

42
0:04:23,269 --> 0:04:24,350
And what?

43
0:04:25,439 --> 0:04:26,639
Shooting his mouth off again?

44
0:04:26,639 --> 0:04:29,740
No doubt angering the wrong sorts of people.

45
0:04:29,839 --> 0:04:32,180
And so now we pay the price.

46
0:04:32,740 --> 0:04:33,729
Careful.

47
0:04:33,730 --> 0:04:34,278
What do you want?

48
0:04:34,279 --> 0:04:35,239
The strength before him.

49
0:04:35,240 --> 0:04:37,759
Like we're not the ones making

50
0:04:39,040 --> 0:04:40,199
cookies out.

51
0:04:40,199 --> 0:04:43,720
I'd like to keep my So let's in these conversations.

52
0:04:51,040 --> 0:04:53,199
You are not going anywhere.

53
0:04:53,740 --> 0:04:54,389
Okay?

54
0:04:57,839 --> 0:04:58,399
Yeah.

55
0:05:32,439 --> 0:05:33,149
Hi,

56
0:05:39,689 --> 0:05:40,350
but

57
0:05:41,339 --> 0:05:42,278
try and benefit both.

58
0:05:42,279 --> 0:05:43,139
Fry.

59
0:06:06,899 --> 0:06:08,920
Wait.

60
0:06:17,490 --> 0:06:18,089
No,

61
0:06:24,439 --> 0:06:27,449
Carter will be the pie night.

62
0:06:38,850 --> 0:06:39,430
No,

63
0:06:46,639 --> 0:06:48,189
it's you, your uncle.

64
0:06:48,189 --> 0:06:50,039
Something attacking needs help.

65
0:06:50,040 --> 0:06:51,449
Go to him.

66
0:07:05,339 --> 0:07:05,899
Yeah,

67
0:07:18,639 --> 0:07:20,170
it seems my plan

68
0:07:22,939 --> 0:07:24,160
now we've got a

69
0:07:24,790 --> 0:07:26,529
my brother tonight with you.

70
0:07:27,040 --> 0:07:30,470
I won't go on ahead and root out that thing.

71
0:07:30,550 --> 0:07:31,850
See that just

72
0:07:33,189 --> 0:07:33,750
now?

73
0:07:34,439 --> 0:07:35,839
Yeah, Yeah,

74
0:07:39,139 --> 0:07:39,699
yeah,

75
0:07:46,040 --> 0:07:46,600
yeah,

76
0:07:56,139 --> 0:07:56,699
Yeah.

77
0:08:45,740 --> 0:08:50,629
It said, Gary, you will remain here to coordinate the imaginary.

78
0:08:51,460 --> 0:08:56,679
But Jessica will organise our forces in the city and send word when it's time to strike.

79
0:08:57,250 --> 0:08:58,200
Good book.

80
0:08:58,440 --> 0:09:01,788
Your job is to calm the citizens once the deed is done.

81
0:09:01,789 --> 0:09:02,428
What other debris?

82
0:09:02,429 --> 0:09:03,870
Akona Mario.

83
0:09:03,940 --> 0:09:06,199
He continues to arrest my forces.

84
0:09:06,200 --> 0:09:10,029
And I feel he discovered what we intend is always been trouble.

85
0:09:10,100 --> 0:09:14,139
Just like that past Argo Brother saying Let me reunite them.

86
0:09:14,139 --> 0:09:19,100
Father, There will be plenty of time to clean up the future when we're finished.

87
0:09:20,340 --> 0:09:21,129
No.

88
0:09:21,639 --> 0:09:23,250
Is that anything goes

89
0:09:24,139 --> 0:09:27,700
Libyan Father of understanding,

90
0:09:28,740 --> 0:09:30,570
Understanding Guy

91
0:09:32,440 --> 0:09:33,509
My home.

92
0:09:33,509 --> 0:09:35,029
On what?

93
0:09:35,139 --> 0:09:37,479
Mario party has invited the seat.

94
0:09:37,480 --> 0:09:38,789
He comes for you.

95
0:09:39,460 --> 0:09:41,450
Let's not keep him waiting.

96
0:09:58,669 --> 0:09:59,250
Yeah,

97
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:03,600
yeah.

98
0:10:04,340 --> 0:10:04,899
No,

99
0:10:27,190 --> 0:10:27,860
no

100
0:10:39,440 --> 0:10:40,000
yeah

101
0:10:49,039 --> 0:10:51,779
Make sure your day comes quick.

102
0:11:00,200 --> 0:11:00,899
Oh,

103
0:11:01,960 --> 0:11:02,610
yeah,

104
0:11:05,860 --> 0:11:06,590
yeah,

105
0:11:12,240 --> 0:11:12,799
yeah

106
0:11:24,389 --> 0:11:30,869
The Eyrie de Patsy Thie, youngest member of the second most notorious Florentine banking family.

107
0:11:30,870 --> 0:11:34,440
This kid knew how to burn right through his father's money.

108
0:11:34,500 --> 0:11:41,399
Outside of spending sprees involving weaponry, exotic animals and clothes, he was fiercely competitive.

109
0:11:41,409 --> 0:11:48,549
V ery hosted races of all kinds voting, horseback riding, running forthem rigged, of course.

110
0:11:48,590 --> 0:11:49,599
And get this.

111
0:11:49,600 --> 0:12:00,200
If through some amazing stroke of luck he ever lost, he'd invite the winner's entire family over for a victory dinner and serve them a meal to die for.

112
0:12:03,549 --> 0:12:05,620
What are you and your allies planning?

113
0:12:05,830 --> 0:12:07,889
Is this what my father discovered?

114
0:12:08,090 --> 0:12:09,809
Is this why he was killed?

115
0:12:10,820 --> 0:12:12,350
I'm sorry.

116
0:12:12,580 --> 0:12:14,909
Were you hoping for a confession?

117
0:12:15,769 --> 0:12:17,009
So do you, man.

118
0:12:17,539 --> 0:12:19,120
What a sword again.

119
0:12:19,500 --> 0:12:20,570
Did you?

120
0:12:21,220 --> 0:12:24,019
But I feel like a maritime re spare.

121
0:12:24,019 --> 0:12:24,329
Okay?

122
0:12:24,330 --> 0:12:25,009
Profits.

123
0:12:25,009 --> 0:12:30,450
You show some respect, respect the role, that tapping.

124
0:12:30,759 --> 0:12:33,889
Do you think he would have shown either of us such kindness?

125
0:12:33,889 --> 0:12:35,450
You are not theory.

126
0:12:35,539 --> 0:12:36,990
Do not become you.

127
0:12:39,740 --> 0:12:40,089
Kayla.

128
0:12:40,090 --> 0:12:43,710
Marty Tvl, Apache, Get your copy request.

129
0:12:46,340 --> 0:12:47,439
Take this.

130
0:12:47,440 --> 0:12:49,250
Read it when you have the time.

131
0:12:49,500 --> 0:12:51,549
Our work here is finished.

132
0:12:51,580 --> 0:12:53,350
That has returned to the Vienna.

133
0:12:56,539 --> 0:12:57,100
Yeah,

134
0:13:32,940 --> 0:13:33,740
four.

135
0:13:34,799 --> 0:13:37,190
I may be expensive, but

136
0:13:57,919 --> 0:13:59,209
And here he is.

137
0:13:59,210 --> 0:14:06,778
Our camp Yomi wasted no time starting the celebration on Why not?

138
0:14:06,779 --> 0:14:10,959
You've done us a great service nipple with very dead.

139
0:14:10,960 --> 0:14:14,309
La Toscana will grow quiet once more.

140
0:14:14,409 --> 0:14:16,389
Do you know what that means?

141
0:14:16,389 --> 0:14:16,808
Faster.

142
0:14:16,809 --> 0:14:19,058
Level to toe, John.

143
0:14:19,059 --> 0:14:20,940
All very helpful.

144
0:14:22,740 --> 0:14:23,349
What?

145
0:14:23,350 --> 0:14:24,659
It's true.

146
0:14:25,779 --> 0:14:26,278
Gum.

147
0:14:26,279 --> 0:14:27,889
It's you walk with me.

148
0:14:27,889 --> 0:14:28,769
Yes,

149
0:14:35,210 --> 0:14:35,709
the pots.

150
0:14:35,710 --> 0:14:38,549
The answer to another Spaniard

151
0:14:39,169 --> 0:14:46,779
is Rodrigo Borgia, one of the most powerful men in all of Europe And leader of the Templar Order,

152
0:14:48,500 --> 0:14:52,750
which makes him responsible for the murder of my father and brothers.

153
0:14:52,750 --> 0:14:55,749
Yes, And he will kill you too.

154
0:14:55,750 --> 0:14:57,500
Given the chance.

155
0:14:57,690 --> 0:14:59,319
Then I must stand against him.

156
0:14:59,320 --> 0:15:01,019
If I wish to be free.

157
0:15:01,019 --> 0:15:04,649
But not until every other Templar has fallen to my blade.

158
0:15:05,210 --> 0:15:06,109
Others least what?

159
0:15:06,110 --> 0:15:07,250
Guide me.

160
0:15:07,450 --> 0:15:09,450
Where will you go next?

161
0:15:10,460 --> 0:15:12,459
You didn't say Jessica.

162
0:15:12,460 --> 0:15:14,950
The bats, you will share the fate of his son.

163
0:15:15,600 --> 0:15:17,350
A sensible next step.

164
0:15:17,629 --> 0:15:20,450
No doubt he intends evil for the city.

165
0:15:21,220 --> 0:15:22,599
All right, that's enough.

166
0:15:22,600 --> 0:15:24,549
Grimm talk for one night.

167
0:15:24,559 --> 0:15:26,750
I'll be in my study if you need me.

168
0:15:28,500 --> 0:15:30,950
I shall read the letter my uncle gave me.

169
0:15:34,639 --> 0:15:35,079
Mr.

170
0:15:35,080 --> 0:15:36,500
Francesco,

171
0:15:37,009 --> 0:15:40,629
I have down as requested and spoken with your son.

172
0:15:40,940 --> 0:15:43,839
I agree with your assessment, though.

173
0:15:43,840 --> 0:15:45,370
Only in art.

174
0:15:45,590 --> 0:15:50,340
Yes, there is brash and brawn toe act without forethought.

175
0:15:50,480 --> 0:15:54,990
And he has a habit of treating the Majin ari like playthings.

176
0:15:55,100 --> 0:16:00,440
I have received reports of at least three men being this figure as a resolve.

177
0:16:00,740 --> 0:16:06,450
But I do not thinking, as you put it, beyond repair.

178
0:16:06,830 --> 0:16:14,389
Rather, I believe the solution to be a simple matter is seeks your approval.

179
0:16:14,519 --> 0:16:16,029
You're a teach.

180
0:16:16,269 --> 0:16:23,750
These outbursts movies are a result of insecurities or out of a sense of inadequacy.

181
0:16:23,940 --> 0:16:30,649
He speaks of you often and fondly and expresses a desire to be closer to you.

182
0:16:30,740 --> 0:16:35,750
So if he is allowed on foul on angry.

183
0:16:35,940 --> 0:16:39,678
I believe it is simply because it wants to be noticed.

184
0:16:39,679 --> 0:16:41,559
It wants to be laughed

185
0:16:42,370 --> 0:16:45,649
at as you see fit on the information I've given you.

186
0:16:45,649 --> 0:16:46,460
Hear?

187
0:16:46,639 --> 0:16:55,700
But I must ask that we end this correspondence worried to discover the nature of our conversations.

188
0:16:56,029 --> 0:16:58,850
I fear what might become of me.

189
0:16:59,539 --> 0:17:01,339
Yours in confidence.

190
0:17:01,340 --> 0:17:02,379
Fragile.

191
0:17:17,240 --> 0:17:17,859
Okay.

192
0:17:36,640 --> 0:17:37,240
Okay.

193
0:17:47,440 --> 0:17:48,160
Two,

194
0:17:49,839 --> 0:17:50,549
two,

195
0:17:52,539 --> 0:17:53,259
two.

196
0:17:56,440 --> 0:17:57,049
Okay.

197
0:18:26,640 --> 0:18:27,200
Yeah.

198
0:19:35,869 --> 0:19:37,200
Look familiar.

199
0:19:37,579 --> 0:19:38,189
Well, that's good.

200
0:19:38,190 --> 0:19:39,298
Ex pages.

201
0:19:39,299 --> 0:19:40,189
Yes.

202
0:19:40,190 --> 0:19:44,279
Your father managed to find and translate a few before he

203
0:19:44,819 --> 0:19:45,559
here.

204
0:19:47,730 --> 0:19:49,849
This is not your father's work.

205
0:19:50,099 --> 0:19:52,269
Someone else has translated it.

206
0:19:52,269 --> 0:19:54,759
Leonardo da Vinci, a friend.

207
0:19:56,019 --> 0:19:59,838
Do you see the way the words cross from one page to the next?

208
0:19:59,839 --> 0:20:02,349
That is something underneath it all.

209
0:20:02,990 --> 0:20:04,660
Some kind of map.

210
0:20:05,140 --> 0:20:06,879
Where is it supposed to lead?

211
0:20:06,880 --> 0:20:12,538
Your father and I managed to make out bits of a prophecy scroll across these pages.

212
0:20:12,539 --> 0:20:17,950
It was written by an assassin like us, who long ago held a piece of Eden.

213
0:20:18,220 --> 0:20:20,759
His name was all tight here.

214
0:20:20,839 --> 0:20:25,249
He spoke of something powerful and ancient, hidden beneath the land.

215
0:20:25,250 --> 0:20:26,038
What is it?

216
0:20:26,039 --> 0:20:27,409
What indeed?

217
0:20:27,410 --> 0:20:32,229
Solving that little mystery is exactly why we collected these pages.

218
0:20:32,230 --> 0:20:33,759
They let me help.

219
0:20:34,099 --> 0:20:36,549
It's time I take on my father's work.

220
0:20:37,039 --> 0:20:38,349
All I eat

221
0:20:38,950 --> 0:20:41,230
start with the page I took from Vieri.

222
0:20:41,369 --> 0:20:43,318
They are not the word decoded for us.

223
0:20:43,319 --> 0:20:44,170
Ben.

224
0:20:44,240 --> 0:20:47,660
Return here when time permits and we'll add it to the wall.

225
0:20:59,740 --> 0:21:00,369
Hey,

226
0:22:34,740 --> 0:22:35,400
but

227
0:23:13,539 --> 0:23:14,259
all right,

228
0:23:35,039 --> 0:23:35,599
No

229
0:23:49,660 --> 0:23:50,149
prices.

230
0:23:50,150 --> 0:23:51,400
I have missed

231
0:23:52,200 --> 0:23:52,920
you.

232
0:24:38,940 --> 0:24:39,529
What?

233
0:24:42,140 --> 0:24:42,700
Yeah,

234
0:25:02,940 --> 0:25:03,880
yeah,

235
0:25:20,940 --> 0:25:21,500
yeah,

236
0:25:58,539 --> 0:25:59,259
right.

237
0:26:00,640 --> 0:26:02,720
Expected, but like

238
0:26:06,940 --> 0:26:07,579
Okay,

239
0:26:18,240 --> 0:26:18,829
Okay.

240
0:26:25,029 --> 0:26:28,509
So no, Claudia, our uncle is own mostro.

241
0:26:28,509 --> 0:26:29,838
This is outrageous.

242
0:26:29,839 --> 0:26:31,229
What's happened?

243
0:26:31,230 --> 0:26:33,048
He's making me work.

244
0:26:33,049 --> 0:26:36,509
If father was here, I'd never be stuck behind a desk like this.

245
0:26:36,509 --> 0:26:43,429
And whether the terms of this suppose that enslavement since someone decided we're going to stay here.

246
0:26:43,430 --> 0:26:47,038
Seo Marios suggested we try and find the money to repair the villa.

247
0:26:47,039 --> 0:26:49,179
Problem is, there isn't any.

248
0:26:49,180 --> 0:26:51,009
I bet I can bring in some money.

249
0:26:51,009 --> 0:26:51,929
Oh, great.

250
0:26:51,930 --> 0:26:53,338
More work for me?

251
0:26:53,339 --> 0:26:59,358
Well, bigness UMA, If you start paying for improvements to the town, I'll keep track of them in this book.

252
0:26:59,359 --> 0:27:05,068
And since I have nothing better to do, I'll also make note of any objects you bring in from the outside.

253
0:27:05,069 --> 0:27:09,879
If you actually get this place up and running, travellers might visit and spend money.

254
0:27:09,880 --> 0:27:13,038
Although I doubt anyone will want to come this far out of the city.

255
0:27:13,039 --> 0:27:16,239
But if they do, I'll keep the money we make in his chest.

256
0:27:16,240 --> 0:27:19,288
You're going to have to show up to take it to the bank yourself.

257
0:27:19,289 --> 0:27:23,338
Because when it gets full, I'm just going to take the extra cash for myself.

258
0:27:23,339 --> 0:27:25,140
Capital D'oh!

259
0:27:51,339 --> 0:27:51,900
Yeah,

260
0:28:05,740 --> 0:28:06,910
one John.

261
0:28:07,140 --> 0:28:09,209
Is there something wrong, Sam?

262
0:28:09,210 --> 0:28:11,288
Are you hired me to deal with this mess?

263
0:28:11,289 --> 0:28:15,088
But I'm an architect, not a miracle worker without money.

264
0:28:15,089 --> 0:28:17,028
I can't fix any of these buildings.

265
0:28:17,029 --> 0:28:21,459
And if someone brought you money, then we'd be in business.

266
0:28:21,460 --> 0:28:22,769
You must be serious.

267
0:28:22,769 --> 0:28:24,450
You're in my ripe

268
0:28:25,329 --> 0:28:26,199
uncle.

269
0:28:26,200 --> 0:28:27,629
I like this architect.

270
0:28:27,630 --> 0:28:30,459
Oh, he gets very observant when he can smell my.

271
0:28:30,460 --> 0:28:32,969
If you want to fix up this town, I'm going to need it.

272
0:28:32,970 --> 0:28:35,919
I have a price list here for new shops and renovations.

273
0:28:35,920 --> 0:28:37,179
Just bring me gold.

274
0:28:37,180 --> 0:28:39,308
Make a choice and I'll begin at once.

275
0:28:39,309 --> 0:28:44,919
If I build you a shop, you, as the landlord, can purchase goods there at lower rates.

276
0:28:44,920 --> 0:28:48,609
If you invested more minding the shop, you get an even greater discount.

277
0:28:48,660 --> 0:28:58,220
As for renovations, well, you'll be bringing the town and villa back to life as Sir Mario tells me that was very important to your great great grandfather.

278
0:28:58,339 --> 0:29:05,889
Plus, when you buy shops and renovations, you'll be increasing the number of people who visit, causing your income to increase it.

279
0:29:05,890 --> 0:29:07,950
So let's take a look, shall we?

280
0:29:24,539 --> 0:29:25,099
No,

281
0:29:26,039 --> 0:29:26,640
no.

282
0:29:35,390 --> 0:29:36,049
What?

283
0:29:54,940 --> 0:29:55,660
Two?

284
0:30:14,940 --> 0:30:15,519
Yeah,

285
0:30:18,299 --> 0:30:19,609
One job.

286
0:30:30,740 --> 0:30:31,319
Hey,

287
0:30:47,740 --> 0:30:49,349
it's you, my boy.

288
0:30:49,400 --> 0:30:52,049
I think it's time I showed you something.

289
0:31:30,539 --> 0:31:32,449
This is the sanctuary.

290
0:31:32,450 --> 0:31:39,299
It was built by my great grandfather to honour the memory of the assassin order and protected secrets.

291
0:31:39,440 --> 0:31:40,539
Look out!

292
0:31:40,940 --> 0:31:46,240
These are the assassins who guarded the freedom of humanity when it was most threatened.

293
0:31:46,460 --> 0:31:48,980
And this is the armour of Alta Here.

294
0:31:49,240 --> 0:31:51,889
Little is known about alternatives life.

295
0:31:51,890 --> 0:31:54,759
But his armour is light and very strong.

296
0:31:55,049 --> 0:31:58,449
I give it to you, but I don't know how to retrieve it.

297
0:31:58,450 --> 0:32:04,549
My great grandfather told me it would remain locked away until all its protectors were made whole.

298
0:32:04,730 --> 0:32:13,450
I heard rumours of creeps located throughout Italian hidden tombs field with treasure where these six were moved centuries ago.

299
0:32:13,640 --> 0:32:16,390
Maybe they have something to do with it.

300
0:32:16,599 --> 0:32:22,098
In my younger days, I saw the six myself with no success.

301
0:32:22,099 --> 0:32:24,740
Perhaps you will have better luck

302
0:32:27,440 --> 0:32:28,029
what?

303
0:32:28,690 --> 0:32:31,338
In order to achieve perfect synchronisation with That's you.

304
0:32:31,339 --> 0:32:33,349
You have to get that armour.

305
0:32:57,140 --> 0:32:57,730
Okay?

306
0:33:15,140 --> 0:33:15,730
Okay.

307
0:33:22,240 --> 0:33:22,829
What?

308
0:33:32,240 --> 0:33:32,980
Okay.

309
0:34:34,539 --> 0:34:35,099
Yeah.

310
0:34:36,440 --> 0:34:37,139
Okay.

311
0:35:07,340 --> 0:35:07,929
Yeah.

312
0:36:25,530 --> 0:36:26,170
What?

313
0:36:29,730 --> 0:36:30,289
Yeah.

314
0:36:42,929 --> 0:36:43,610
Oh,

315
0:37:03,230 --> 0:37:03,789
no.

316
0:37:16,329 --> 0:37:16,980
Good.

317
0:37:48,269 --> 0:37:48,938
Good to see you.

318
0:37:48,940 --> 0:37:52,059
At your care for a bit of practise.

319
0:38:29,920 --> 0:38:32,030
I've known for this day.

320
0:38:32,119 --> 0:38:34,280
Look, you're just

321
0:38:36,000 --> 0:38:37,380
not such

322
0:38:43,619 --> 0:38:44,280
Yeah,

323
0:38:50,820 --> 0:38:51,380
yeah,

324
0:39:11,719 --> 0:39:12,280
yeah,

325
0:39:15,920 --> 0:39:16,480
yeah.

326
0:39:19,019 --> 0:39:19,619
Oh,

327
0:39:29,019 --> 0:39:30,239
Well done.

328
0:39:54,019 --> 0:39:54,670
No.

329
0:39:58,219 --> 0:39:58,780
Yeah.

330
0:39:59,320 --> 0:40:00,929
Oh, no,

331
0:40:04,110 --> 0:40:04,670
No.

332
0:40:18,250 --> 0:40:18,860
What?

333
0:40:23,809 --> 0:40:24,730
Thanks.

334
0:40:33,010 --> 0:40:33,570
Yeah,

335
0:40:57,519 --> 0:40:59,320
let's see it another time.

336
0:41:01,610 --> 0:41:03,009
Much better.

337
0:41:03,010 --> 0:41:04,730
One last time now.

338
0:41:06,550 --> 0:41:07,908
Such skill.

339
0:41:07,909 --> 0:41:09,429
Such grace.

340
0:41:15,610 --> 0:41:16,318
Yes.

341
0:41:16,320 --> 0:41:18,260
It's best we take a break.

342
0:41:35,610 --> 0:41:38,429
All who need aid are welcome here.

343
0:41:55,050 --> 0:41:55,869
Yeah,

344
0:42:57,500 --> 0:42:58,338
it's you.

345
0:42:58,340 --> 0:42:59,809
You're still alive.

346
0:43:00,300 --> 0:43:02,079
Who get this place.

347
0:43:02,349 --> 0:43:04,719
The past two years have been kind to you.

348
0:43:04,949 --> 0:43:07,420
But you are not the same at all, are you?

349
0:43:08,900 --> 0:43:11,840
I was hoping you might be able to help me with something.

350
0:43:11,900 --> 0:43:13,809
Anything for you, my friend.

351
0:43:14,570 --> 0:43:15,658
Ha ha.

352
0:43:15,659 --> 0:43:17,068
You found another one.

353
0:43:17,070 --> 0:43:18,719
How exciting

354
0:43:20,699 --> 0:43:23,198
This one is tricky to break.

355
0:43:23,199 --> 0:43:26,298
Clever in its use of ancient languages.

356
0:43:26,300 --> 0:43:36,048
Maybe if I just Oh, Oh, it seems to be a manual of sorts for different assassination techniques.

357
0:43:36,050 --> 0:43:38,119
Wait, What's that?

358
0:43:38,449 --> 0:43:40,568
It's not so much a design this time.

359
0:43:40,570 --> 0:43:42,420
Just a series of sketches.

360
0:43:42,489 --> 0:43:43,219
Mmm.

361
0:43:43,300 --> 0:43:45,219
I went to make of all this

362
0:43:46,519 --> 0:43:48,038
off course.

363
0:43:48,039 --> 0:43:49,158
And why not?

364
0:43:49,159 --> 0:43:50,728
What an inspired idea.

365
0:43:50,730 --> 0:43:52,268
Can you make it for me while I try?

366
0:43:52,269 --> 0:43:53,788
What's in that manual fragment?

367
0:43:53,789 --> 0:43:54,548
Take it.

368
0:43:54,550 --> 0:43:58,000
I'll have my assistant set up some dummies for you to practise with.

369
0:43:58,000 --> 0:43:59,719
Hey, be gentle,

370
0:44:22,190 --> 0:44:22,780
okay?

371
0:44:39,989 --> 0:44:40,550
Yeah,

372
0:44:44,789 --> 0:44:45,449
Okay.

373
0:45:02,789 --> 0:45:03,489
No.

374
0:45:17,590 --> 0:45:18,300
Okay.

375
0:45:26,690 --> 0:45:27,800
In your area.

376
0:45:40,969 --> 0:45:41,659
Oh,

377
0:45:42,789 --> 0:45:46,650
and leave you feeling depressed and rejuvenate

378
0:45:56,190 --> 0:46:00,210
Next week's public mass God would have

379
0:46:02,579 --> 0:46:03,320
Hey,

380
0:46:10,789 --> 0:46:11,570
watch

381
0:46:16,380 --> 0:46:17,210
not

382
0:46:20,780 --> 0:46:21,900
only mine.

383
0:46:22,429 --> 0:46:23,199
Really.

384
0:46:26,179 --> 0:46:26,989
Hi.

385
0:46:27,889 --> 0:46:29,000
Things could be

386
0:46:39,179 --> 0:46:39,750
No,

387
0:46:46,619 --> 0:46:47,588
I've done it.

388
0:46:47,590 --> 0:46:48,388
Come quickly.

389
0:46:48,389 --> 0:46:49,289
Look,

390
0:46:50,880 --> 0:46:52,489
take it trite.

391
0:46:53,840 --> 0:46:54,418
Thank you, Leo.

392
0:46:54,420 --> 0:46:54,958

0:53:59,079 --> 0:54:00,548
My money!

0:54:00,550 --> 0:54:02,550
I don't have your money.

0:54:09,440 --> 0:54:10,000

You're making a big mistake, my friend.

454
0:54:16,210 --> 0:54:17,610
Enough of these.

455
0:54:18,199 --> 0:54:19,048
Enough indeed.

456
0:54:19,050 --> 0:54:20,460
Why don't you give up

457
0:54:22,860 --> 0:54:27,090

458
0:54:30,349 --> 0:54:31,348
I swear.

459
0:54:31,349 --> 0:54:33,750
I'll run you through when I catch you.

460
0:54:33,840 --> 0:54:35,659
Now, where's the fun in that?

461
0:54:40,429 --> 0:54:42,760
I really have no interest in hurting you.

462
0:54:42,889 --> 0:54:45,460
So give me back my money and we'll call it even.

463
0:54:45,639 --> 0:54:47,269
Not so fast.

464
0:54:48,090 --> 0:54:49,489
What do you want?

465
0:54:49,500 --> 0:54:50,650
What are you?

466
0:54:50,940 --> 0:54:53,309
They called me many things.

467
0:54:53,989 --> 0:54:55,170

Mr Ed's.

471
0:55:05,679 --> 0:55:07,159
Do you know my name?

472
0:55:08,550 --> 0:55:11,550
It is my business to know everything in this city.

473
0:55:11,639 --> 0:55:13,538
Isn't that why you're here?

474
0:55:13,539 --> 0:55:14,458
Indeed.

475
0:55:14,460 --> 0:55:16,138
Need to find someone.

476
0:55:16,139 --> 0:55:18,568
I know where he'll be before even he does.

477
0:55:18,570 --> 0:55:19,659
Who?

478
0:55:20,110 --> 0:55:21,988
Francesco the patsy.

479
0:55:21,989 --> 0:55:24,068
There's word on the street of a caravan.

480
0:55:24,070 --> 0:55:26,250
Just arrived from Aroma.

481
0:55:26,260 --> 0:55:29,610
This secret meeting at sunset tonight.

482
0:55:29,739 --> 0:55:32,838
You can learn something at Francesco's whereabouts there.

483
0:55:32,840 --> 0:55:35,058
You know where it is to be held much.

484
0:55:35,059 --> 0:55:35,860
Yeah.

485
0:55:36,150 --> 0:55:39,110
Let me know when you are ready and we'll go.

486
0:55:40,239 --> 0:55:41,619
Uh, yes.

487
0:55:42,860 --> 0:55:44,230
Here is your money.

488
0:55:47,639 --> 0:55:48,349
No,

0:56:14,230 --> 0:56:14,949

0:56:30,349 --> 0:56:31,150

0:56:39,829 --> 0:56:41,228
no stay back.

492
0:56:41,230 --> 0:56:42,460
God

493
0:56:43,610 --> 0:56:45,978
knows prices for noble ways.

494
0:56:45,980 --> 0:56:48,468
Are more people in an offer on the place?

495
0:56:48,469 --> 0:56:49,739
Too much.

496
0:56:53,619 --> 0:56:55,739
But what

497
0:57:05,219 --> 0:57:06,148
creature?

498
0:57:06,150 --> 0:57:07,449
Tell him from me.

499
0:57:15,090 --> 0:57:16,678
For me, it's mine.

500
0:57:16,679 --> 0:57:17,958
Take it and leave.

501
0:57:17,960 --> 0:57:18,989
Senor.

502
0:57:19,340 --> 0:57:21,058
I only follow orders.

503
0:57:21,059 --> 0:57:22,400
Why are you

504
0:57:25,730 --> 0:57:27,519

505
0:57:35,230 --> 0:57:36,110
Money?

506
0:57:36,730 --> 0:57:37,469
She

507
0:57:41,929 --> 0:57:43,730
You'll never be paid before.

508
0:57:52,030 --> 0:57:52,948
Date of birth.

509
0:57:52,949 --> 0:57:55,630
Unknown profession Thief.

510
0:57:55,760 --> 0:57:57,378
There is almost no trace of Laval.

511
0:57:57,380 --> 0:58:00,259
Pay the fox in the history books.

512
0:58:00,260 --> 0:58:02,388
The names, obviously a suiting him.

513
0:58:02,389 --> 0:58:07,590
But for whom is anyone's guess What small data is available seems to be almost mythical.

514
0:58:07,780 --> 0:58:24,208
Live all pay is reported to have robbed the pope's carriage without any of his guards noticing, including the pope who was sitting inside the carriage one night in 14 67 he was seen on the rooftops of the Palazzo Della Signoria, the Palazzo Medici and Santa Croce e all at the same time.

515
0:58:24,210 --> 0:58:31,969
Some claim that he's immortal, never ageing, while others say that his violet eyes can see through buildings perusing the contents inside.

516
0:58:35,219 --> 0:58:37,188
Hey, follow me.

517
0:58:37,190 --> 0:58:39,918
But we must move fast.

518
0:58:39,920 --> 0:58:41,368
Think you can keep up?

519
0:58:41,369 --> 0:58:42,809
That's your problem.

520
0:58:51,619 --> 0:58:52,179
Yeah,

521
0:58:58,820 --> 0:58:59,380
Yeah,

522
0:59:06,289 --> 0:59:06,949
yeah.

523
0:59:17,119 --> 0:59:18,968
What are you doing back there?

524
0:59:18,969 --> 0:59:20,829
I said to keep up with me.

525
0:59:23,119 --> 0:59:23,739
What?

526
0:59:52,920 --> 0:59:53,480
Yeah,

527
1:00:03,710 --> 1:00:04,269
Yeah.

528
1:00:07,409 --> 1:00:09,030
Oh, no.

529
1:00:11,510 --> 1:00:12,070
Yeah.

530
1:00:16,369 --> 1:00:17,519
Here we are.

531
1:00:18,309 --> 1:00:22,348
Francesco de Pazzi is meeting his people inside that church.

532
1:00:22,349 --> 1:00:23,798
How do I join them?

533
1:00:23,800 --> 1:00:27,378
There are catacombs that run under the city.

534
1:00:27,380 --> 1:00:31,039
They will lead you to a place where you can even start up on the meeting.

535
1:00:31,579 --> 1:00:35,730
Grape, that stone handle hearing it, then slide it down.

536
1:00:36,409 --> 1:00:37,638
Thank you for all your help.

537
1:00:37,639 --> 1:00:38,630
Bo Bae.

538
1:00:39,809 --> 1:00:41,210
One for two.

539
1:00:49,309 --> 1:00:49,869
No.

540
1:00:51,809 --> 1:00:52,369
Yeah.

541
1:00:54,210 --> 1:00:54,769
No,

542
1:01:02,210 --> 1:01:03,400
it's what?

543
1:01:06,130 --> 1:01:07,599
Get the album.

544
1:01:08,150 --> 1:01:08,789
No,

545
1:01:12,409 --> 1:01:13,000
no,

546
1:01:19,670 --> 1:01:21,788
there may be one bed left at the done.

547
1:01:21,789 --> 1:01:22,679
Janine,

548
1:01:27,309 --> 1:01:27,989
huh?

549
1:01:31,809 --> 1:01:32,369
No,

550
1:01:43,010 --> 1:01:43,730
really.

551
1:01:53,010 --> 1:01:58,808
The first great basilica in Florence, Santa Maria Novella was consecrated in 14 20.

552
1:01:58,809 --> 1:02:06,989
Despite being unfinished, the famous humanist Leon Battista Alberti designed the upper facade, completing the church in 14 70.

553
1:02:07,079 --> 1:02:15,728
However, Santa Maria Novella is origins extend back before the Crusades to an ancient oratory located on the same site with a hidden tomb underneath.

554
1:02:15,730 --> 1:02:18,809
As of today, the tomb has not been uncovered.

555
1:02:18,900 --> 1:02:24,728
On a related note, one of my favourite quotes is located inside the basilica written on the image of a tomb.

556
1:02:24,730 --> 1:02:26,568
I was once what you are and what I am.

557
1:02:26,570 --> 1:02:27,809
You will become.

558
1:02:31,699 --> 1:02:32,298
Renaissance.

559
1:02:32,300 --> 1:02:38,420
Thieves were usually wanderers who could vanish at the first sign of trouble, making it hard for guards to track them.

560
1:02:38,599 --> 1:02:41,718
Black market business in Renaissance Italy was booming.

561
1:02:41,719 --> 1:02:45,488
Muggings in the major cities were fairly common, as were murders.

562
1:02:45,489 --> 1:02:51,828
Often, strollers were attacked in the dead of night, killed, robbed and then rolled into the nearest river or canal.

563
1:02:51,829 --> 1:02:54,738
Even if a thief merely stole rather than killed.

564
1:02:54,739 --> 1:02:57,348
The penalties, if caught, were often unduly harsh.

565
1:02:57,349 --> 1:02:58,798
Torture was common.

566
1:02:58,800 --> 1:03:02,559
Thieves were put in stocks and sometimes even publicly executed.

567
1:03:02,679 --> 1:03:07,458
In order to avoid punishment, Thieves often created bonds of trust amongst each other.

568
1:03:07,460 --> 1:03:14,210
Each was supposed to tell the rest his dirty secrets, which meant that each thief potentially held his comrades lives in his hands.

569
1:03:18,199 --> 1:03:23,208
The centre of Florentine business, the Mercado Vecchio, served all the shopping needs of the city.

570
1:03:23,210 --> 1:03:34,670
To quote Antonio Poochie, 1/14 century Florentine poet, physicians dwelled around for every ill, and here were linen cloths and flax merchants, pork vendors and apothecaries.

571
1:03:34,769 --> 1:03:42,588
The Makato was established first in Roman times as the site of the forum, and only in 10 30 was first documented is a marketplace staple.

572
1:03:42,590 --> 1:03:48,199
Foods from the countryside, like grain, were the most popular good sold, followed by Wolf.

573
1:03:48,300 --> 1:03:54,498
However, if shoppers became bored with the basics to quote 1/15 century poet, he'll Pandora media.

574
1:03:54,500 --> 1:03:59,690
They're halfway down the street stands a happy whorehouse, which you will know by the very smell of the place.

575
1:04:04,300 --> 1:04:11,170
Palazzo Comunale e San Gimignano is town Hall was built just the seat of the municipal government in 12 88.

576
1:04:11,309 --> 1:04:18,248
As befits the City of Towers, one of the council's earliest acts inside their new home was to construct the Tory gross on top.

577
1:04:18,250 --> 1:04:20,988
The Podesta took up residence at the Palazzo Comunale.

578
1:04:20,989 --> 1:04:22,719
Ian, 13 37

579
1:04:26,500 --> 1:04:32,828
named after Saint Gemini Ennis, who supposedly conjured up a dense fog to save the city of Modena from Attila the Hun.

580
1:04:32,829 --> 1:04:35,888
San Gimignano was founded in the third century.

581
1:04:35,889 --> 1:04:41,059
The city grew from the 10th century on word as a stopping point along the pilgrimage route to Rome.

582
1:04:41,269 --> 1:04:42,678
In 11 99.

583
1:04:42,679 --> 1:04:48,988
Once its citizens grew wealthy, San Gimignano, separated from the bishops of Volterra, became self governing.

1:04:48,989 --> 1:04:55,718
The city's distinctive towers were created as its wealthy citizens competed to display how much money was actually in their pockets.

585
1:04:55,719 --> 1:05:02,718
In its heyday, the city had 72 towers, but the plague of 13 48 decimated San Gimignano.

586
1:05:02,719 --> 1:05:06,138
Without money for upkeep, the town started to fall apart.

587
1:05:06,139 --> 1:05:09,809
The council appealed to Florence, and Florence took control.

1:05:45,289 --> 1:05:53,539
When the state that was bankrolling them ran out of money, the soldiers would disband frequently to be hired to destroy the very city they had just fought to defend.

593
1:05:53,659 --> 1:05:57,548
Some mercenaries were honourable, fighting for a cause they believed in.

594
1:05:57,550 --> 1:06:01,068
But men such as these were few and far between where they existed.
