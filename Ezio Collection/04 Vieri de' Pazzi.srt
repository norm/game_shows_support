1
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,966
Ezio! What are you doing here?

2
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:11,000
EZIO: Taking responsibility. Vieri troubles you because of me.

3
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:15,866
Vieri troubles us because he's a Templar, and we are Assassins.

4
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,400
EZIO: Either way, I wish to help.

5
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,066
Va bene (Alright), then listen close.

6
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:26,900
First we must find a way inside the city, though it seems Vieri expects us.

7
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,566
He has sealed the gates and sent his men to guard them.

8
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,933
Fortunately for us, the city is larger than his host.

9
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:38,256
The Southern Gate suffers for it, so this is where we'll strike, pronti (ready)?

10
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,900
MARIO: Alright, Ezio, here's how it is going to work.

11
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,433
MARIO: My men and I will distract the guards.

12
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:05,133
MARIO: Once we have engaged them,
get yourself over the wall and find a way to open the gate.

13
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:09,233
MARIO: Take these throwing knives, use them to dispatch the archers.

14
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,166
EZIO: I'm ready when you are.

15
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,000
MARIO: Then let us begin.

16
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,500
MARIO: All'attacco (Charge)!

17
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,500
MARIO: Well done, Ezio, we are in!

18
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,633
MARIO: This way, men!

19
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,566
MARIO: I want you to distract those guards,
and keep them from raising the alarm.

20
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,266
MARIO: Hopefully it will buy me enough time to find and silence Vieri.

21
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,400
EZIO: Va bene.

22
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,800
MARIO: Wait, nipote, take a few of my men with you just to 
be safe.

23
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,166
MARIO: Come join me once they're dealt with.

24
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,233
GUARD 1: What's Vieri up to now?

25
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,300
GUARD 2: No-one knows, but something has him on edge.

26
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,566
GUARD 2: How else to explain all the patrols?

27
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,366
EZIO: I'll signal again when you should follow.
GUARD 3: We're meant to be soldiers.

28
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:24,366
GUARD 3: Instead he's turned us into nursemaids. And why?

29
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,699
GUARD 2: Shooting his mouth off again, no doubt.

30
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,899
GUARD 2: Angering the wrong sorts of people. And so now we pay the price.

31
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:37,133
GUARD 1: Careful, or do you want us dragged before him like Bernardo was?

32
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,933
GUARD 2: Poor bastard, I heard Vieri took his eyes.

33
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,466
GUARD 1: I'd like to keep mine, so let's end this conversation.

34
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:51,166
MERCENARY: Ezio! Your uncle's under attack and needs help! Go to him!

35
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,566
MARIO: Ah nipote, there you are.

36
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,266
MARIO: It seems my plan has hit something of a snag.

37
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:24,699
MARIO: Vieri's men ambushed us, and now we've got our hands full.

38
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,933
MARIO: My brothers and I will deal with these guards.

39
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:30,399
MARIO: I want you to go on ahead and root out that snake!

40
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,333
MARIO: See that justice is served!

41
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:50,366
SPANIARD: It's settled. Vieri, you will remain here
to coordinate the mercenari (mercenaries).

42
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,399
SPANIARD: Francesco will organise our forces in the city,
and send word when it's time to strike.

43
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:01,533
SPANIARD: Jacopo, your job is to calm the citizens once the deed is done.

44
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,600
VIERI: What about that ubriacone (drunkard) Mario?

45
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:08,266
He continues to harrass my forces, and I fear he'll discover what we intend.

46
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:12,066
He's always been trouble, just like that bastardo brother of his.

47
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,899
Then let me reunite them, father.

48
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,133
SPANIARD: There will be plenty of time
to clean up the rifiuti (trash) when we're finished.

49
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,000
Now, is there anything else?

50
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:27,799
SPANIARD: Muy bien (Very well). May the Father of Understanding guide you.

51
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,600
ALL: May the Father of Understanding guide you.

52
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,966
GUARD: Comandante (Commander)! Comandante!

53
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,066
What?

54
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:38,533
Mario Auditore has invited the city! He comes for you!

55
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,200
He, he, he. Then let's not keep him waiting.

56
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,500
VIERI: Fear not, Ezio, I'll make sure your death comes quickly.

57
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,466
SHAUN: Vieri de' Pazzi.

58
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,600
SHAUN: The youngest member
of the second most notorious Florentine banking family.

59
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,166
SHAUN: This kid knew how to burn right through his father's money.

60
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:41,133
SHAUN: Outside of spending sprees involving weaponry,
exotic animals, and clothes, he was fiercely competitive.

61
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,700
SHAUN: Vieri hosted races of all kinds.

62
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,566
SHAUN: Boating, horseback riding, running.

63
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:48,266
SHAUN: All of them rigged, of course.

64
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,333
SHAUN: And get this.

65
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:57,000
SHAUN: If through some amazing stroke of luck he ever lost,
he'd invite the winner's entire family over for a victory dinner.

66
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,933
SHAUN: And serve them a meal to die for.

67
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,366
EZIO: What are you and your allies planning?

68
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,633
EZIO: Is this what my father discovered?

69
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,533
EZIO: Is this why he was killed?

70
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:14,633
VIERI: I'm sorry, were you hoping for a confession?

71
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,366
Pezzo di merda (Piece of shit)!

72
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,700
Vorrei solo che avessi sofferto di più (I only wish you'd suffered more)!

73
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,466
Hai avuto la fine che meritavi (You met the fate you deserved)!

74
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,333
Spero che bru– (I hope yo–)

75
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,100
MARIO: Enough, Ezio! Show some respect.

76
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,733
Respect? After all that's happened?

77
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,866
Do you think he would have shown either of us such kindness?

78
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,733
You are not Vieri. Do not become him.

79
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,600
Che la morte ti dia la pace che cercavi
(May death provide the peace you sought).

80
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,766
Requiescat in pace (Rest in peace).

81
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,000
Take this, read it when you have the time.

82
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,533
Our work here is finished.

83
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,266
Let us return to the villa.

84
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,766
MARIO: And here he is, our campione (champion) Ezio!

85
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,399
CROWD: All hail Ezio!

86
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,166
I see you've wasted no time starting the celebration.

87
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,533
And why not? You've done us a great service, nipote.

88
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:14,033
With Vieri dead, la Toscana (Tuscany) will grow quiet once more.

89
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,299
Do you know what that means?

90
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,366
Basta lavorare (No more work)!

91
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:20,000
Si passa tutto il giorno a bere (We can drink all day)!

92
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,733
E a puttane (And with whores)!

93
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,166
What? It's true!

94
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,633
CROWD: [laughs]

95
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,899
Come Ezio, walk with me.

96
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,700
Yes, uncle.

97
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:38,266
EZIO: The Pazzi answer to another, a Spaniard.

98
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,100
MARIO: He is Rodrigo Borgia.

99
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,000
MARIO: One of the most powerful men in all of Europe.

100
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
MARIO: And leader of the Templar Order.

101
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,733
EZIO: Which makes him responsible for the murder of my father and brothers.

102
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:57,233
MARIO: Yes, and he will kill you too, given the chance.

103
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,966
EZIO: Then I must stand against him if I wish to be free.

104
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,366
EZIO: But not until every other Templar has fallen to my blade.

105
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,000
EZIO: Father's list will guide me.

106
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:09,466
MARIO: Where will you go next?

107
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:14,633
EZIO: Firenze. Francesco de' Pazzi will share the fate of his son.

108
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,366
MARIO: A sensible next step.

109
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:20,466
MARIO: No doubt he intends evil for the city.

110
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,566
Alright, that's enough grim talk for one night.

111
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,766
I'll be in my study if you need me.

112
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,966
I shall read the letter my uncle gave me.

113
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,166
Look familiar?

114
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,266
Other Codex pages.

115
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:44,233
Yes, your father managed to find and translate a few before he…

116
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,533
Here.

117
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,066
This is not your father's work.

118
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,233
Someone else has translated it.

119
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,733
Leonardo da Vinci, a friend.

120
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,799
Do you see the way the words cross from one page to the next?

121
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,299
There is something underneath it all.

122
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,633
Some kind of map.

123
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,833
Where is it supposed to lead?

124
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:12,500
Your father and I managed to make out
bits of a prophecy scrawled across these pages.

125
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,933
It was written by an assassin like us, who long ago held a "Piece of Eden".

126
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,733
His name was Altaïr.

127
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,200
He spoke of something powerful and ancient, hidden beneath the land.

128
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,000
What is it?

129
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,366
What indeed?

130
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:32,200
Solving that little mystery is exactly why we collected these pages.

131
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,733
Then let me help.

132
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,500
It's time I take on my father's work.

133
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,299
All of it.

134
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,200
I'll start with the page I took from Vieri.

135
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,299
Leonardo will decode it for us.

136
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:47,566
Bene. Return here when time permits and we'll add it to the wall.

137
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,700
Salute, Claudia!

138
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,233
Our uncle is un mostro (a monster).

139
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,566
This is outrageous!

140
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,966
What's happened?

141
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,766
He's making me work.

142
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:36,233
If father was here, I'd never be stuck behind a desk like this.

143
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:40,099
And what are the terms of this supposed enslavement?

144
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,400
Since someone decided we're going to stay here.

145
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,766
Zio (Uncle) Mario suggested we try and find the money to repair the villa.

146
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:48,900
Problem is, there isn't any.

147
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,733
I bet I can bring in some money.

148
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,066
Oh, great, more work for me.

149
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,066
Well, belissimo (fine).

150
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:59,333
If you start paying for improvements to the town,
I'll keep track of them in this book.

151
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:05,033
And since I have nothing better to do,
I'll also make note of any objects you bring in from the outside.

152
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:09,833
If you actually get this place up and running,
travellers might visit and spend money.

153
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:13,000
Although I doubt anyone will want to come this far out of the city.

154
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,200
But if they do, I'll keep the money we make in this chest.

155
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,266
You're going to have to show up to take it to the bank yourself.

156
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:23,299
Because when it gets full, I'm just going to take the extra cash for myself.

157
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,066
Capito (Understand)?

158
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,099
Deal.

159
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:08,733
EZIO: Buongiorno. Is there something wrong?

160
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,333
ARCHITECT: Ser Mario hired me to deal with this mess.

161
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,400
ARCHITECT: But I'm an architetto (architect), not a miracle worker.

162
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,066
ARCHITECT: Without money I can't fix any of these buildings.

163
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:19,433
EZIO: And if someone brought you money?

164
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,500
ARCHITECT: Ehi, then we'd be in business.

165
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,166
ARCHITECT: You must be Ser Ezio, am I right?

166
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,133
EZIO: Uncle! I like this architetto!

167
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,500
MARIO: He gets very observant when he can smell money.

168
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,000
ARCHITECT: If you want to fix up this town, I'm going to need it.

169
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,966
ARCHITECT: I have a price list here for new shops and renovations.

170
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,266
ARCHITECT: Just bring me gold, make a choice, and I'll begin at once.

171
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:44,900
ARCHITECT: If I build you a shop, you, as the landlord,
can purchase goods there at lower rates.

172
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,633
ARCHITECT: If you investe more money in the shop,
you get an even greater discount.

173
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,633
ARCHITECT: As for renovations, well…

174
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:53,099
ARCHITECT: You'll be bringing the town and villa back to life.

175
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:58,266
ARCHITECT: As Ser Mario tells me that was
very important to your great-great-grandfather.

176
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:03,666
ARCHITECT: Plus, when you buy shops and renovations,
you'll be increasing the number of people who visit.

177
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,933
ARCHITECT: Causing your income to increase!

178
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,000
ARCHITECT: So let's take a look, shall we?

179
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,500
ARCHITECT: Buon viaggio (Safe journey)!

180
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,433
Ezio, my boy.

181
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,133
I think it's time I showed you something.

182
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,266
This is the Sanctuary.

183
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:34,133
It was built by my great grandfather to honour the memory
of the Assassin order and protect its secrets.

184
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,366
Look around.

185
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:41,066
These are the Assassins who guarded
the freedom of humanity when it was most threatened.

186
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,799
And this is the armour of Altaïr.

187
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,366
Little is known about Altaïr's life.

188
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:49,500
But his armour is light and very strong.

189
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:53,166
I'd give it to you, but I don't know how to retrieve it.

190
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,266
My great grandfather told me it would remain locked away
until all its protectors were made whole.

191
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:02,866
I heard rumours of crypts located throughout Italia.

192
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:08,200
Hidden tombs filled with treasure, where these six were moved centuries ago.

193
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:11,133
Maybe they have something to do with it.

194
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:16,833
In my younger days, I sought the six myself, with no success.

195
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,466
Perhaps you will have better luck.

196
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,233
REBECCA: In order to achieve
perfect synchronisation with Ezio, you have to get that armour.

197
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,433
Good to see you, Ezio. Care for a bit of practise?

198
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:32,333
TRAINER: Ha, such skill, such grace.

199
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,866
TRAINER: Well done, Ezio.

200
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,633
TRAINER: Well done, Ezio.

201
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:53,900
TRAINER: Let's see it another time.

202
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:59,099
TRAINER: Much better, one last time now.

203
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:03,800
TRAINER: Ha, such skill, such grace.

204
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,633
TRAINER: Yes, it's best we take a break.

205
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:54,166
Ezio! You're still alive.

206
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,433
Look at this place!

207
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,099
The past two years have been kind to you.

208
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,800
But you are not the same at all, are you?

209
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:06,433
I was hoping you might be able to help me with something.

210
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:08,166
Anything for you, my friend.

211
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:13,099
Ha ha! You found another one, how exciting!

212
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,900
This one is tricky to break.

213
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,000
Clever in its use of ancient languages.

214
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,699
Maybe if I just … oh! Ohhh.

215
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,666
It seems to be a manual of sorts.

216
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,633
For different assassination techniques.

217
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:31,266
May I see it?

218
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:32,599
Wait, What's that?

219
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:37,000
It's not so much a design this time, just a series of sketches.

220
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,699
Hmm, what to make of all this?

221
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,866
Ho ho, of course, and why not?

222
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:45,433
What an inspired idea.

223
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:48,500
Can you make it for me while I try what's in that manual fragment?

224
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,633
Take it, I'll have my assistant set up some dummies for you to practise with.

225
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,366
Ehi, Vincenzo!

226
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:43,533
I've done it! Come quickly, look!

227
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:46,733
Take it, try it.

228
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,433
Thank you, Leonardo.

229
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,433
Non c'è di che (Don't mention it).

230
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,966
There's someone I need to "see" while I'm here.

231
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,433
I can not approach him publicly.

232
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,733
Would you know a way?

233
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,466
La Volpe.

234
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:03,266
"The Fox"?

235
00:47:03,266 --> 00:47:04,300
Sssh!

236
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,599
Capisco (I understand)…

237
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,733
But do you know where The Fox might roam?

238
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:11,666
Perhaps near the mercato (market) where the thieves dwell.

239
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,833
Sta attento, amico (Be safe, friend).

240
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
SUBJECT 16: Power doesn't die, it's passed on.

241
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:54,033
EZIO: What? My pouch, my money!

242
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:57,199
THIEF: Oh your money? I don't have your money! [laughs]

243
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,466
EZIO: Get back here!

244
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:02,833
THIEF: Make me!

245
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:08,366
EZIO: You're making a big mistake, my friend.

246
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,033
EZIO: Enough of this!

247
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,900
THIEF: Enough indeed, why don't you give up?

248
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,066
EZIO: Return what you've stolen!

249
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:21,533
THIEF: Would if I could, but I can't.

250
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:28,199
EZIO: I swear I'll run you through when I catch you!

251
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,099
THIEF: Now, where's the fun in that?

252
00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:37,199
I really have no interest in hurting you.

253
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,900
So give me back my money and we'll call it even.

254
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:41,699
Not so fast.

255
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,099
What do you want? Who are you?

256
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,733
They called me many things.

257
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:52,166
Murderer. Tagliagole (Cutthroat). Thief.

258
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,866
But you may call me La Volpe.

259
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:59,233
At your service, Messer Ezio. [laughs]

260
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,599
How do you know my name?

261
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It is my business to know everything in this city.

262
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:07,966
Isn't that why you're here?

263
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:10,566
Indeed, I need to find someone.

264
00:55:10,566 --> 00:55:13,000
To know where he'll be before even he does.

265
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,099
Who?

266
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:16,433
Francesco de' Pazzi.

267
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:20,699
There's word on the street of a caravan just arrived from Roma.

268
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:24,166
A secret meeting at sunset tonight.

269
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:27,266
You can learn something of Francesco's whereabouts there.

270
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:29,166
Do you know where it is to be held?

271
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,300
Ma certo (Of course).

272
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,533
Let me know when you are ready and we'll go.

273
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:38,666
Ah, yes, [laughs] here is your money.

274
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:34,166
Follow me, but we must move fast.

275
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,599
Think you can keep up?

276
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,033
Nessun problema (No problem).

277
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:13,400
LA VOLPE: [laughs] What are you doing back there?

278
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,066
LA VOLPE: I said to keep up with me!

279
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,033
Here we are.

280
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,833
Francesco de' Pazzi is meeting his people inside that church.

281
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,300
EZIO: How do I join them?

282
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,866
There are catacombs that run under the city.

283
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:25,533
They will lead you to a place where you can eavesdrop on the meeting.

284
01:00:26,066 --> 01:00:30,233
Grip that stone handle, turn it, then slide it down.

285
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,000
Thank you for all your help, Volpe.

286
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,699
Buona fortuna (Good luck).
