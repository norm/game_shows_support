1
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,319
My name is Desmond Miles.

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm a prisoner of war.

3
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,129
A war I never knew existed.

4
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,511
Waged by two groups I never thought were real, Templars and Assassins.

5
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,640
The Animus showed me the truth.

6
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,045
The things I've seen, the things I've been.

7
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:53,590
A thousand years of history flowing
through my veins brought to life by this machine.

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,130
They're using using it, using me to search for something.

9
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,679
They call it The Apple.

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,049
It's an artefact, one of many so called Pieces of Eden.

11
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,189
Templars collect them, it's how they stay in power.

12
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,622
And if the Templars get their hands on another one everything will change.

13
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,280
They want to make us all their slaves.

14
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:21,658
When they first brought me here,
I was afraid of what would happen if I tried to fight back.

15
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,469
Now?

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,049
Now I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't.

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,650
But I can't do it alone.

18
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,930
And maybe I don't have to.

19
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,328
I met someone.

20
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,511
Her name is Lucy.

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,640
I think she's on my side.

22
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,150
She's gone now.

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,870
Taken away by that bastard Warren Vidic and his Templar masters.

24
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,299
I don't know what will happen to her.

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,189
Or what will happen to me.

26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,730
All I know is I need to get out of here, and I need to do it soon.

27
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,265
My name is Desmond Miles and this is my story.

28
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:03,758
We have to go.

29
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,831
Lucy, where have you been? Why did they–

30
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:06,994
Now!

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,389
LUCY: Desmond.

32
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:28,900
Get in.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,689
What's with the blood? Are you okay?

34
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,860
Look, we have maybe ten minutes, maybe, before they figure out what I've done.

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,966
If we're not out of here and on the road before, then…

36
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:38,954
Wait, we're leaving?

37
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:42,628
Desmond, I promise I'll answer all of your questions later.

38
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,638
But right now, I need you to just shut up and do what I say.

39
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,596
So please, get in the Animus.

40
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,250
Alright.

41
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,050
LUCY: Hurry up!

42
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,277
AAAH! [pants]

43
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,602
Spingi (Push)! Spingi!

44
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,044
Di nuovo (Again)!

45
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,704
AAAAH!

46
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:45,290
NURSE: Si, si, brava (Yes, yes, good)!

47
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,349
It is a boy.

48
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,039
Oh my love! My dispiace (I'm sorry)!

49
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,938
I was at the bank when they told me.

50
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,480
Did I miss it? Am I too late?

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,308
Give him here.

52
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,299
Giovanni…

53
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,750
GIOVANNI: Ssh my love, it will be alright.

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,509
Tu sei un Auditore (You are an Auditore).

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,933
Sei un combettente (You are a fighter).

56
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,509
Perciò combatti (So fight)!

57
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,726
Listen to him! A fine set of lungs!

58
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:35,755
What shall we call him, my love?

59
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,796
Ezio. Ezio Auditore da Firenze!

60
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,850
Get up, let's go.

61
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,727
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need a second.

62
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:01,189
There isn't time Desmond, we have to leave.

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,750
LUCY: Come on, Desmond!

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,139
DESMOND: Ah, really getting out of here, huh?

65
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,649
LUCY: Stay close.

66
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,149
DESMOND: Nice walls, fancy.

67
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,914
LUCY: We need to move!

68
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:34,379
DESMOND: Coming, I'm coming!

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,379
GUARD 1: Hey! You're not supposed to be up here!

70
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,070
GUARD 1: Open this door!

71
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,419
GUARD 2: I'm calling it in.

72
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,079
GUARD 2: We have a breach in the research wing.

73
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,316
DESMOND: Wait up!
GUARD 2: I repeat, there's been a breach in the research wing.

74
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,500
LUCY: Desmond, over here.

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,159
GUARD 2: Requesting backup from all available security personnel.

76
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,449
GUARD 2: Subjects appear to be armed.

77
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,279
LUCY: Hurry up!

78
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,269
GUARD: There they are, don't let them get away!

79
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,050
DESMOND: Holy shit!

80
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,527
LUCY: Come on, we need to keep moving.

81
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,250
DESMOND: Look at this place.

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,219
LUCY: Come on Desmond, let's go.

83
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,689
DESMOND: What about the cameras?

84
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,879
LUCY: I rigged them to loop old footage.

85
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,589
LUCY: How do you think I managed to hide all your
night time snooping from Abstergo?

86
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,850
DESMOND: You're good.

87
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,500
LUCY: So I've been told.

88
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,739
LUCY: But they're onto us now.

89
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,879
LUCY: We need to hurry.

90
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,970
LUCY: Careful.

91
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,739
LUCY: We need to get to that elevator on the other side of the room.

92
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,939
LUCY: Follow my lead, but keep an eye out for security.

93
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,649
LUCY: I'd rather avoid a fight.

94
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,349
DESMOND: Boy, these must be a bitch to clean.

95
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,079
LUCY: Do you want us to get caught?

96
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,120
DESMOND: Is that an Animus?

97
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,949
LUCY: Stay close. 

98
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:18,870
DESMOND: What the…?!

99
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,629
DESMOND: How many of them are there?

100
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,870
LUCY: Stay close.

101
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,444
DESMOND: Is it Animuses or Animii?
LUCY: Stay back!

102
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,028
DESMOND: What do you think, Lucy? Lucy?!

103
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,879
DESMOND: What do they need with all of them?

104
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,927
LUCY: Desmond, shut the fuck up. Please.

105
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,539
Fuck! I thought this card would work.

106
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:22,149
It must be on a separate system, and I don't have the code.

107
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,134
Wait.

108
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,049
DESMOND: Shit!

109
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:32,849
DESMOND: Come on!

110
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,908
How did you do that?

111
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,750
I don't know.

112
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,779
Let's go.

113
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,509
LUCY: It's always something.

114
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,281
DESMOND: What was that in the Animus?

115
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,641
DESMOND: Subject 16? 

116
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,278
DESMOND: Ezio Audi… Audisomething.

117
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,590
LUCY: I think we've been wrong all along.

118
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,479
LUCY: That's why we need to get out of here.

119
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,579
LUCY: Vidic and the Templars, they're only part of the problem.

120
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,629
DESMOND: What do you mean?

121
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,969
LUCY: I'll explain when we get there.

122
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,350
DESMOND: Get where?

123
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,649
Get in.

124
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,049
You're joking.

125
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,654
It's for your own protection.

126
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,149
DESMOND: Oh man.

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,149
We're almost there.

128
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,205
DESMOND: Thanks for that, it was great. 

129
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,380
DESMOND: Being shoved in the trunk, bouncing around. Loved it.

130
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,049
LUCY: This way.

131
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,799
DESMOND: So, gonna tell me what's going on now?

132
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,189
LUCY: There was a reason for the escape, Desmond.

133
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,080
DESMOND: Figures.

134
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,178
LUCY: We need your help.

135
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,740
DESMOND: For what? Another treasure hunt through time?

136
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,619
LUCY: Abstergo's gonna replace their Apple of Eden.

137
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,489
LUCY: The map your ancestor found guarantees it.

138
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,075
LUCY: The other Assassins they'll do what they can where they can, but…

139
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,039
DESMOND: What? What is it?

140
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,939
LUCY: We're losing this war, Desmond.

141
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,360
LUCY: The Templars are too powerful, and every day more of us die.

142
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,603
DESMOND: I still don't see how I fit into things.

143
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:50,051
LUCY: We're going to train you, turn you into one of us.

144
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,149
DESMOND: What?

145
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,668
DESMOND: No, no, you've seen me in action. I'm no good at this.

146
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:58,045
DESMOND: And even if I was, it would take months, years even.

147
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,548
LUCY: No, not with the Animus, not with the bleeding effect.

148
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,639
DESMOND: But I'm just one guy.

149
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,918
LUCY: Sometimes that's all you need.

150
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,339
DESMOND: So that's why you found him, my ancestor.

151
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,299
DESMOND: What was his name? Ezio?

152
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,339
LUCY: If you can follow in his footsteps,
you'll learn everything he did, just like he did.

153
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,489
LUCY: Years of training absorbed in a matter of days.

154
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,350
DESMOND: You broke me out of Abstergo
and brought me here just to make me an Assassin?

155
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,149
Look, there's more to it than that, but it'll have to wait.

156
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,341
Trust me, okay?

157
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,700
Alright, I'm in. Tell me what you need.

158
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,429
Really? You're sure?

159
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,418
I thought you'd be happy about this.

160
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,069
Sorry, I'm just a little surprised.

161
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,269
I spent the whole ride over here figuring out
how I was gonna convince you to do this.

162
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,289
Save it.

163
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,398
After what those Templar bastards put me through I'm ready, willing and able.

164
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,049
Thank you.

165
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,908
Lucy! You made it.

166
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,359
God, it's been so long.

167
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,559
Seven years, can you believe it?

168
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,024
SHAUN: Indeed, welcome back.

169
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,970
SHAUN: Ah, so this must be the infamous Subject 17.

170
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,538
SHAUN: Desmond Miles was it?

171
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,249
DESMOND: Who are you?

172
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,710
I'm sorry, where are my manners?

173
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,929
I'm Shaun Hastings. This is Rebecca Crane.

174
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,028
Nice to meet you, Desmond.

175
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,339
SHAUN: Right, well, it's been lovely chatting,
but if you don't mind Desmond, it's best we get straight to work.

176
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,234
Time is precious. Doubly so, these days.

177
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,729
REBECCA: We've got everything set up and ready, Lucy.

178
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,115
Just say the word and we'll get going.

179
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,239
Here, I brought you something.

180
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,109
A parting gift from Abstergo.

181
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,610
Whoa! Their memory core!

182
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,678
This is amazing!

183
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,990
With their data, things are go go a lot faster.

184
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,049
REBECCA: I'll get to work on merging the code.

185
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,949
DESMOND: Hey, listen, I just wanted to say thank you and that I'm sorry.

186
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,908
Sorry?

187
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,999
Yeah, you know, before. Everything at Abstergo.

188
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,579
It was just… I wasn't ready.

189
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,649
It's okay.

190
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,200
No, going through all that,
knowing that the Templars still exist, what they're planning…

191
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,720
What's done is done, Desmond.

192
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,803
You're here now and that's what matters.

193
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,959
Hey Desmond, what's up?

194
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,979
Just wondering what your role is in all this?

195
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:44,778
I take care of Baby.

196
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,469
It's my job to keep her up and running.

197
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,719
"Baby"? You mean the Animus?

198
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,667
Actually, I prefer Animus 2.0.

199
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,840
Since Baby's twice as awesome as anything you'll find at Abstergo.

200
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,969
The Templars might have deeper pockets than us,
but they've got no ambition, no passion, no competitive edge!

201
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,950
That's why even with all their resources,
anything they can do I can do better. Faster, too.

202
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,919
Anyway, take a seat when you're ready and we can get started.

203
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,679
I just need to make a few more adjustments.

204
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,034
DESMOND: What's all this stuff for?

205
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,700
"This stuff" Desmond?

206
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,299
Oh "this stuff" is nothing special, really.

207
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:36,139
"This stuff" is just the "stuff" that keeps
our entire operation from falling apart, really.

208
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,300
It requires a great deal of concentration to keep it all moving.

209
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,206
So you'll forgive me if I don't have time to play meet and greet.

210
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,079
REBECCA: Shaun's in charge of maintaining our knowledge archives.

211
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,739
REBECCA: It's like a digital library.

212
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,461
He'll be riding shotgun with me while you're in the Animus.

213
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:54,377
So if you come across anything of note people, places, events, et cetera.

214
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:58,240
He'll create database entries you can consult for additional information.

215
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,908
SHAUN: Yeah, it's not just databases, though.

216
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:04,509
SHAUN: I also provide tactical support for the other Assassins.

217
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,609
You know Desmond, the ones who are out there
actually doing stuff, risking their lives, little things like that.

218
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,977
Lucy, I've been seeing things.

219
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:31,779
Symbols in my bedroom, the code on the keypad, just like Altaïr.

220
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,538
It's from the bleeding effect.

221
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,209
You're taking on more than your ancestor's memories.

222
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,429
You're taking on their skills too.

223
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,171
In this case, Eagle Vision.

224
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,229
Skills?

225
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,919
LUCY: You're more receptive now.

226
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,202
So if all goes well, everything Ezio learns in the Animus, you'll learn too.

227
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:50,279
You really think this will work? That I'll become an Assassin?

228
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,349
LUCY: You already are an Assassin.

229
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,199
You'll just be better at it.

230
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,269
SHAUN: Yeah, hopefully much better at it.

231
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,166
SHAUN: I mean, seriously, I saw the tapes from Abstergo.

232
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,378
SHAUN: You didn't even try an escape.

233
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:02,598
DESMOND: What a dick.

234
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,779
LUCY: Sorry Desmond, I've got some stuff to take care of. We can talk more later.

235
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,660
So how does this work?

236
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,848
DESMOND: Of course.

237
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,160
Deep breath.

238
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,437
Aaah!

239
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,473
SHAUN: Oh what are you, a tiny child?

240
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,528
Shaun!

241
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,619
DESMOND: Well!

242
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,759
REBECCA: Here we go.

243
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,088
Insieme per la vittoria (We stand together for victory)!

244
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,669
CROWD: Insieme! Insieme!

245
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,235
Silenzio (silence), my friends, silenzio!

246
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,259
Grazie (Thank you).

247
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,450
Do you know what brings us here tonight?

248
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,789
Honour.

249
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:15,636
Vieri de' Pazzi slanders my family's name
and forces his own miseries upon us. If we—

250
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:18,234
VIERI: Enough of your nonsense, grullo (idiot)!

251
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:24,900
Buona sera (good evening) Vieri. We were just talking about you.

252
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm surprised to see you here.

253
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:31,009
I thought the Pazzi hired others to do their dirty work.

254
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:36,517
It's your family that cries for guards when there's trouble, codardo (coward)!

255
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,519
Afraid to handle things yourself?

256
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,630
Your sister seemed quite satisfied with the handling I gave her earlier.

257
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,940
Uccidetelo (Kill him)!

258
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:11,750
Ehi (Hey)! Behind you!

259
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:15,779
Federico! What are you doing here?

260
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,549
I wanted to see if baby brother had finally learned how to fight.

261
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,681
And?

262
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:27,599
Heh, you have style. But endurance is what counts.

263
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:31,029
Let's see how many of them you can ruin before they get the best of you.

264
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,649
Fall back! Fall back!

265
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,700
Hold on.

266
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:23,826
What? We've almost won this!

267
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:24,930
FEDERICO: Your lip.

268
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:26,838
Just a scratch.

269
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,400
Let the doctor decide.

270
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,949
It's not necessary.

271
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,439
Besides, I have no money for this doctor of yours.

272
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,034
Heh, wasted it on women and wine, uh?

273
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:36,720
I'd hardly call it wasted.

274
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,758
Lend me some florins then. Or have you done the same?

275
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:41,730
[laughs]

276
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,450
Search them, there's bound to be something in their pockets.

277
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,608
Va bene (Alright). That should be enough.

278
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,849
Let's get out of here before the guards arrive.

279
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,349
Hurry Ezio, the sooner we're done with the doctor, the sooner we can sleep.

280
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:31,549
DOCTOR: Do you require medical assistance?

281
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,549
FEDERICO: Ben trovato (Good to see you), doctor.

282
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,389
DOCTOR: Mmm, fratelli Auditore (Auditore brothers).

283
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,450
DOCTOR: Why am I not surprised?

284
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,890
DOCTOR: You made quite a mess of yourself, young man.

285
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:45,789
EZIO: It's nothing, really.

286
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,252
You must help him, that pretty face is his only asset.

287
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,839
Fottiti (Go fuck yourself)!

288
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,965
DOCTOR: There we are, now get out of here.

289
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:01,909
EZIO: Grazie.

290
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,759
FEDERICO: This way.

291
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,589
FEDERICO: Quite a night.

292
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,839
EZIO: Indeed. I only wish they were all as much fun.

293
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,351
EZIO: Oh, wait, they are!

294
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:16,674
[laughter]

295
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,726
FEDERICO: We should head home, Ezio.

296
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,518
FEDERICO: Father's sure to be wondering where we've gone.

297
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:24,800
EZIO: Yes, and I'd rather avoid a lecture.

298
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,858
FEDERICO: Up for a little race then?

299
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:27,940
EZIO: To where?

300
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,690
FEDERICO: Uhh... roof of that church.

301
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:42,268
FEDERICO: On the count of three. Uno. Due. Tre!

302
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,160
FEDERICO: Baby brother still has much to learn.

303
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,103
FEDERICO: Come on, tartaruga (turtle)!

304
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,069
FEDERICO: Baby brother still has much to learn.

305
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,047
FEDERICO: Come on, tartaruga!

306
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,559
Come on, then. This way.

307
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,799
Where are you going?

308
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,480
FEDERICO: You'll see.

309
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,449
FEDERICO: It is a good life we lead, brother.

310
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,163
EZIO: The best. May it never change.

311
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:19,779
FEDERICO: And may it never change us.

312
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,054
Alright, enough of that. We really should head home. Let's go.

313
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:42,669
Wait.

314
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:43,667
What?

315
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,868
Ezio, let Cristina sleep.

316
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:51,639
There will be time enough for that… later.

317
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,759
Ehhh.

318
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,496
Cazzo (Fuck), it's Vieri, I'd better hide.

319
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,279
Keep looking! He couldn't have gotten far!

320
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,660
EZIO: Cristina! Cristina!

321
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,028
CRISTINA: Who's there?

322
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,049
EZIO: Me.

323
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:36,009
Oh, Ezio, I should have known.

324
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,570
EZIO: May I come in?

325
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,548
CRISTINA: Fine, but only for a minute.

326
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,024
EZIO: A minute is all I need.

327
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,538
CRISTINA: Indeed.

328
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,950
EZIO: W–wait, that came out wrong.

329
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,297
Come here.

330
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:54,267
Oh.

331
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,034
Oh Ezio.

332
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,940
Oh Ezio!

333
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,829
ANTONIO: Christina! Christina!

334
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,669
ANTONIO: Sveglia (Wake up)! Your tutor will be here soon!

335
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,630
ANTONIO: Come, my daughter... Is it really so terrible tha–

336
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:43,288
ANTONIO: Figlio d'un cane (Son of a bitch)! What is this?!

337
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:46,406
EZIO: Perdonate, Messere (Forgive me sir)! Chiedo venia (I beg your pardon)!

338
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,466
I'll kill you!

339
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,629
Now, now, that's not necessary.

340
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,858
ANTONIO: Guards! Guards! Voglio la sua testa (Bring me his head)!

341
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:56,619
EZIO: There's really no need for violence.

342
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,568
EZIO: You have me confused with someone else.

343
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,429
EZIO: She needed some help with… some things.

344
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,190
EZIO: I'm mostly innocent.

345
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,460
EZIO: Good morning, Father.

346
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,340
Come with me.

347
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:08,250
EZIO: Is something wrong?

348
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,679
Do you think me blind and deaf, son?

349
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,848
I know all about your fight with Vieri de' Pazzi last night.

350
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:20,239
And then this little visit to Cristina.

351
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,949
GIOVANNI: Your behaviour is unacceptable.

352
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,900
It…

353
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,489
It…

354
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,340
It reminds me of myself when I was your age!

355
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,308
GIOVANNI: I assume these misadventures won't interfere with your work today?

356
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:40,340
No, padre (father). Avete la mia parola (You have my word).

357
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:45,739
I've prepared some documents here for Lorenzo de' Medici to review.

358
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,768
I need them delivered to him.

359
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,340
With haste, father.

360
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,449
Return to me when it's done.

361
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,803
BOETIO: Ah, Ezio, ben trovato (well met)! How are you?

362
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:42,630
EZIO:Come sempre (Same as ever). I have a letter for Messer Lorenzo.

363
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,230
BOETIO: I'll see that he receives it when he returns.

364
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,820
EZIO: Returns?

365
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,929
BOETIO: They've gone to Villa Careggi, I'm afraid.
And not expected back for at least another day.

366
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,230
EZIO: I'll let my father know.

367
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,645
FEDERICO: Keep up the good work.

368
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:40,955
EZIO: Bischero (Penis)!

369
00:45:43,268 --> 00:45:46,194
INSIDE: You worry too much, Giovanni.

370
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,269
INSIDE: Francesco de' Pazzi is in prison.

371
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,573
INSIDE: The threat is ended.

372
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,880
Ah, hello son.

373
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,757
You remember my friend Uberto?

374
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,400
Good morning, Gonfalonieri Alberti.

375
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,158
To you as well, young man.

376
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,300
I trust you delivered the message.

377
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,434
Si, padre (Yes, father), but it seems Lorenzo is out of town.

378
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:12,820
Hmm, I did not anticipate this.

379
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,238
UBERTO: What does it matter?

380
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,699
So you wait another day or two.

381
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,398
Listen, your mother and sister have been looking for you.

382
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,168
I'll need you again in a little while.

383
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,818
But for now, see if you can't help them.

384
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,888
Are you sure?

385
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:28,550
Yes, now if you'll excuse us.

386
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,489
Good to see you Ezio.

387
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:00,960
Ehi Claudia, how are you?

388
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,868
Bene (Okay).

389
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:03,889
You shouldn't keep things from me.

390
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,908
It's Duccio.

391
00:48:05,909 --> 00:48:07,248
What of him?

392
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,868
I think he's been unfaithful.

393
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:11,118
EZIO: Who told you this?

394
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,889
The other girls.

395
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,500
I thought they were my friends.

396
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,278
Harpies, you're better off without them.

397
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,546
I loved him.

398
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,048
No, Claudia, you only thought you did.

399
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,368
He should suffer for what he's done.

400
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,741
Wait here, I'll go have a word with him.

401
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,062
Oh Duccio! It's beautiful!

402
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:48,719
Nothing but the best for you amore mio (my love).

403
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,376
But what of Claudia? I thought you'd been promised to her?

404
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:56,739
Father said I could do much better than an Auditore.

405
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:03,621
Oh birbante (naughty)! Come, let us walk a bit.

406
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:07,159
Walk? I had something else in mind.

407
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:09,000
Oh Duccio!

408
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,409
EZIO: Ehi, lurido porco (dirty pig)!

409
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,880
Ezio, my friend!

410
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:20,000
Ma che ti piglia (What the hell)?!

411
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,058
You insult my sister parading around with this puttana (whore).

412
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,000
DUCCIO: W–w–w–what are you talking about?

413
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:30,000
I saw the gift you gave her, heard the things you said.

414
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:33,658
Maybe your sister shouldn't be so stingy with her virtù (virtue).

415
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,550
You broke her heart.

416
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,619
Ha! And now I'm going to break your face!

417
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,329
DUCCIO: You Auditores all talk big, but when it comes time for action, hah!

418
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:46,759
EZIO: You'll regret ever opening your mouth.

419
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,858
DUCCIO: I could have taught your sister a great many things.

420
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,679
EZIO: Bastardo!

421
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:59,159
DUCCIO: Basta (Stop)! Mi arrendo (I yield)!

422
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,010
EZIO: Stay away from my sister!

423
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,369
Ehi Ezio!

424
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,900
What are you doing out here, Petruccio? You should be in bed.

425
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,718
I want those feathers.

426
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:21,869
EZIO: What for?

427
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:23,167
It's a secret!

428
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,978
If I get them for you, will you go back inside?

429
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,730
Yes, I promise.

430
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,300
Here, as promised.

431
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:12,488
Grazie, brother.

432
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:14,568
You still haven't told me why you want these.

433
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,661
I will. In time.

434
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,010
Buon giorno (good morning), Ezio.

435
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,200
Buon giorno a voi, madre (Good morning to you, mother).
Come state (How are you)?

436
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,269
Sto bene (I'm good), and you?

437
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:12,440
MARIA: Still recovering from last night?

438
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:14,718
I have no idea what you're talking about.

439
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,108
Of course not.

440
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,528
Anyway, I have an errand to run.

441
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,988
I'd like you to join.

442
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:21,340
Con piacere (With pleasure).

443
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:24,022
Come, it's not far from here.

444
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:36,389
MARIA: I know about your fight with Vieri.

445
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,840
EZIO: What fight?

446
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:45,239
MARIA: Per piacere (please), let's not play this game.

447
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,179
EZIO: He spoke ill of us.

448
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:49,028
EZIO: I could not allow him to continue.

449
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,842
MARIA: I'm sure he's having a hard time
dealing with the accusations against his father.

450
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:58,739
MARIA: Francesco de' Pazzi is many things, and none of them good.

451
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,239
MARIA: But even I never suspected he'd be capable of murder.

452
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:04,868
EZIO: What will happen to him?

453
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:07,039
MARIA: I imagine there will be a trial.

454
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:08,863
EZIO: Will Father speak at it?

455
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,218
MARIA: He'll have to, he's the one with the evidence.

456
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,119
EZIO: Still, I wish there was another way.

457
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,010
MARIA: You have nothing to fear.

458
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,980
MARIA: Everyone wants justice done.

459
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:24,539
MARIA: It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but it will pass.

460
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:21,789
MARIA: Here we are.

461
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:33,538
Hello, Leonardo.

462
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:35,041
Madonna Maria!

463
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,869
This is my son, Ezio.

464
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,800
Molto onorato (I am honoured).

465
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,510
L'onore è mio. (The honour is mine.)

466
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,100
Let me go and fetch the paintings. I'll be right back.

467
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:49,139
He's very talented.

468
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,000
EZIO: Immagino (I guess).

469
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,096
Self expression is vital to understanding and enjoying life.

470
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:56,107
You should find an outlet.

471
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,488
I have plenty of outlets.

472
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,300
I meant besides vaginas.

473
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,550
Mother!

474
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,559
Back to your house, then.

475
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:05,849
Si, si.

476
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:08,929
Ezio, help Leonardo, will you?

477
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,712
LEONARDO: So Ezio, what do you do?

478
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
MARIA: He's been working for his father.

479
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,073
LEONARDO: Ah, you're to be a banker.

480
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:26,129
EZIO: For now. And you, art was it?

481
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:30,778
LEONARDO: Truth be told, it's been difficult for me to settle.

482
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,848
LEONARDO: Painting is nice, but I often feel like my work lacks…

483
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:36,998
LEONARDO: I don't know, a purpose, does that make sense?

484
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,168
LEONARDO: I'd rather contribute more practically, more directly.

485
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,094
LEONARDO: Architecture, perhaps, or anatomy.

486
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:45,718
LEONARDO: I'm not content merely to capture the world.

487
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,274
LEONARDO: I want to change it.

488
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:52,099
MARIA: Oh Leonardo, I have no doubt you'll go on to do great things.

489
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:55,264
LEONARDO: Vi ringrazio (I thank you), Madonna. That's kind of you.

490
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:16,929
MARIA: Thank you for your help, son.

491
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:20,608
MARIA: Don't let me keep you from your other duties.

492
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,110
LEONARDO: It was nice to meet you Ezio, I hope our paths cross again.

493
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,230
EZIO: Anch'io (Me too).
