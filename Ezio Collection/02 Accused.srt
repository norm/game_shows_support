1
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:34,579
Ezio, come in son.

2
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,889
I need these packages delivered to associates of mine in the city.

3
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,907
I also need you to retrieve a message for me
from a pigeon coop not too far from here.

4
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,685
Va bene (alright), I'll get it done.

5
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,654
Come back here when you're finished.

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,504
There are some things we need to discuss.

7
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:57,199
And please, my son, stay out of trouble hmm?

8
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,028
You Giovanni's kid?

9
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,146
No idiota (idiot), he just happens to look exactly like the man.

10
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,849
Give it here.

11
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,775
Don't worry boy, we're not contagious.

12
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,849
Least I'm not.

13
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,969
MERCENARY: Here, over here.

14
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,000
EZIO: I have a delivery from—

15
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,449
Giovanni Auditore?

16
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:43,239
Yes.

17
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,500
MERCENARY: Were you followed?

18
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,150
EZIO: No. Why would I be followed?

19
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,689
Give me the package.

20
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,090
Tell your father that they're moving tonight. He should as well.

21
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,837
EZIO: Who's moving? What's going on here?

22
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,134
Wait, come back, explain yourself!

23
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,914
Father? Federico?

24
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,133
Oh! Ser Ezio, thank God.

25
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,934
What happened, where is everyone?

26
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,778
They took your father and brothers to the Palazzo della Signoria, to prison!

27
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,633
And my mother? My sister?

28
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,689
CLAUDIA: Ezio!

29
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,377
EZIO: Claudia!

30
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,499
EZIO: Are you all right?

31
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,518
CLAUDIA: Yes, but mother…

32
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:18,234
ANNETTA: She's in shock.They… when she resisted…

33
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,449
It's not safe here.

34
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,539
Is there some place you can take them?

35
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,209
Yes, yes! To my sister's.

36
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,634
Good, do that. In the meantime, I'll go see my father.

37
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,243
Be careful, Messer Ezio. The guards were looking for you as well.

38
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,450
GIOVANNI: Ezio.

39
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,350
Father, what's happened?

40
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,809
GIOVANNI: Took a bit of a beating, but I'm alright.

41
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,560
What of your mother and sister?

42
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,049
Safe now.

43
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,667
GIOVANNI: Annetta took them?

44
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,418
Yes… wait! You knew this would happen?

45
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,950
Not the way it did, and not this soon.

46
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,778
It doesn't matter now.

47
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,178
What do you mean, explain?

48
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:36,227
There's no time, listen closely.

49
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:40,178
Return to the house. In my office is a hidden door.

50
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,621
Use your talent to find it.

51
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:46,750
Beyond lies a chest, take everything you find inside.

52
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,649
Much of it may seem strange to you, but all of it is important.

53
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,339
Do you understand?

54
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,350
Yes.

55
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,549
Good.

56
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,809
Among the contents is a letter and with it some documents.

57
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,563
I need you to take these documents to Messer Uberto.

58
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,859
GIOVANNI: He was with me in the office this morning.

59
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,038
The Gonfaloniere, I remember. Now, please, tell me what's happening.

60
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,867
Are the Pazzi behind this? There was a note for you at the pigeon coop, it said—

61
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,747
GIOVANNI: Go Ezio! Go now!

62
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:17,019
Hmm, father said there was a door here.

63
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:30,367
I need to bring this to Messer Uberto.

64
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,649
GUARD: Traditore (Traitor)!

65
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,100
EZIO: Hey, what's with the swords?

66
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,470
EZIO: Aren't you supposed to arrest me?

67
00:16:58,789 --> 00:16:59,850
GUARD: No.

68
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,919
EZIO: What do you want then?

69
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,940
GUARD: For you to die!

70
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,970
EZIO: Well, that's not going to happen.

71
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,470
EZIO: So why don't we explore other options?

72
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,720
GUARD: There are no other options.

73
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:23,049
Ezio Auditore? What are you doing here at this hour?

74
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,560
It… I don't…

75
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,801
Wait, child. Take a breath. Collect your thoughts.

76
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,024
My father and brothers have been imprisoned. I was told to bring you this.

77
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:42,849
Ah, I see now. It's a misunderstanding Ezio.

78
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,950
UBERTO: I'll clear everything up.

79
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,369
EZIO: How?

80
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,954
UBERTO: The documents you've given me contain evidence
of a conspiracy against your family and against the city.

81
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,049
I'll present these papers at their hearing in the morning and they will be released.

82
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,410
Thank you, signore.

83
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,357
Of course, my child.

84
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:07,831
Do you need a place to stay? You're more than welcome here.

85
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,200
No grazie. I'll meet you at the piazza.

86
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,385
Don't worry, Ezio. Everything is going to be fine.

87
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,782
UBERTO: Giovanni Auditore!

88
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:01,049
UBERTO: You and your accomplices stand accused off the crime of treason!

89
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,078
UBERTO: Have you any evidence to counter this charge?

90
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,664
Yes, the documents that were delivered to you last night!

91
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,209
I'm afraid I know nothing of these documents.

92
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,390
He's lying! I need to get closer.

93
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:29,759
In the absence of any compelling evidence to the contrary,
I am bound to pronounce you guilty.

94
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:37,500
You and your collaborators are hereby sentenced to death.

95
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,048
You are a traitor, Uberto, and one of them!

96
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:44,610
You may take our lives this day, but we will have yours in return! I swear!

97
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,555
We will—

98
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
Father!

99
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:52,800
There! Grab the boy! He's one of them.

100
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,059
I'll kill you for what you done!

101
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,693
Guards, arrest him!

102
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:06,911
Abbattetelo (Put him down).

103
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:12,591
You'd better run boy, and fast!

104
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,450
SHAUN: I've got a little request for you.

105
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,749
SHAUN: I've identified several strange markings
that I've discovered right across Renaissance Italy.

106
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,845
SHAUN: Now, I don't know what they're doing there,
but I want you to help me find out.

107
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:28,129
SHAUN: Rebecca has marked their general location
in the database with an eye icon.

108
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,448
SHAUN: And she's made them glow as well. Keep an eye out.

109
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,225
ANNETTA: Ser Ezio, thank God. I've been looking everywhere for you.

110
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,440
EZIO: I couldn't stop them Annetta.

111
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,599
EZIO: I tried, I swear, but there were so many guards.

112
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,994
ANNETTA: Please, come with me. We need to get you off the streets.

113
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,909
EZIO: What of my mother and sister?

114
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,430
ANNETTA: They're safe. I'll bring you to them.

115
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,599
EZIO: No, it's too dangerous for us to travel together.

116
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,950
EZIO: Tell me where to go and I'll meet you there.

117
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,220
ANNETTA: My sister's house, just north of the Duomo.

118
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,660
EZIO: I'm on my way.

119
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,818
SHAUN: There's one of the symbols. What does it mean?

120
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,759
SHAUN: It must be there for a reason.

121
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,049
SHAUN: Can you take a closer look?

122
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,748
SHAUN: Hey, try using eagle vision. I've got all day.

123
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,581
REBECCA: Wait, That–that's not possible. This can't be!

124
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,259
REBECCA: Hold on, that's computer code.

125
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,759
REBECCA: Let me compile it.

126
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,246
REBECCA: Oh, shit. It's an encrypted file.

127
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,450
SHAUN: Upload it to my computer, I'm a master at decryption.

128
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,747
REBECCA: I can't, it's only compatible with the Animus itself.

129
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,450
SHAUN: Upload it to Desmond, then… can't believe this.

130
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,869
Hello? This is… er they–they call me Subject 16.

131
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:00,317
Listen, I don't have much time. There's something I have to show you.

132
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,298
We have been lied to this whole time.

133
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:08,000
Everything we know, everything we've been brought up to believe … it's wrong.

134
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:17,228
Okay, um, I've uploaded the evidence, the file that–that–that proves it all.

135
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,516
But I've split it into 20 pieces and locked each with a code.

136
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,359
Can't be too careful.

137
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,932
Queen Isabella… no, not her.

138
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:33,219
Uh, er, what century is it?

139
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,198
Uhh, never mind.

140
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,579
I've hidden the code to the first file inside this programme.

141
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,329
Find it, find them all.

142
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:52,657
And along the way, you'll begin to see the truth.

143
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:57,880
SHAUN: What the he—? How did this get inside our Animus?

144
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,338
LUCY: Oh. Oh! The memory core!

145
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,999
LUCY: We transferred Sixteen's memory data from Abstergo into the Animus 2.0.

146
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:09,659
LUCY: He must have hacked the machine
when Vidic left him alone between sessions.

147
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:12,230
DESMOND: Hold on, wait a second.

148
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,170
DESMOND: The signs on the walls in Abstergo, the ones written in blood.

149
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,056
DESMOND: Those were clues!

150
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:21,241
DESMOND: He was telling us to look for them inside the Animus!

151
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,780
I think we have the wrong building.

152
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,119
No, no, this is it.

153
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,268
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Messer Ezio.

154
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:40,288
Annetta speaks quite highly of you, I can see why.

155
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,250
I appreciate the kind words Madonna.

156
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,699
Ti prego (Please), call me Paola.

157
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:48,208
Thank you for offering your home to my family, Paola.

158
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,000
It was the least I could do.

159
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,451
You must be tired. Perhaps you'd l—

160
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,388
No, grazie. I can't stay.

161
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,800
PAOLA: Why, where are you going?

162
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,119
To kill Uberto Alberti.

163
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,260
I understand your desire for vengeance, but the Gonfaloniere is a powerful man.

164
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,067
You are not a killer, Ezio.

165
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,530
Spare me the lecture.

166
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,278
But I can make you one.

167
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,400
And why are you going to teach me how to kill?

168
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,183
I'm not. I'm going to teach you how to survive. Come.

169
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:26,148
PAOLA: Discretion is paramount in my profession.

170
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,309
PAOLA: We must walk the streets freely, seen but unseen.

171
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,210
PAOLA: You too must learn to blend like us
and become one with the city's crowds.

172
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:38,030
PAOLA: My girls will show you how.

173
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:47,010
COURTESAN: We'll take good care of you.

174
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:37,320
PAOLA: Bene. Now that you've learned to blend,
I'll show you how to use it for more than just moving around.

175
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:40,440
PAOLA: Let's teach you how to steal.

176
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,309
PAOLA: Once you've stolen from someone Ezio, you mustn't linger.

177
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,065
You can go now, girls.

178
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,436
Aww, do we have to?

179
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:51,915
So innocent.

180
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,440
He's cute!

181
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:59,969
Now that you have learned how to approach the enemy,
we need to find you a suitable weapon.

182
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,018
What would you have me use?

183
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:05,038
Ah, but you already have the answer.

184
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,557
Hey, my father's blade and bracer! How did you get them?

185
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:13,858
[laughs] By using the same skills I've just taught you.

186
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,888
It's not exactly in working condition.

187
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:19,238
I assume you're familiar with Leonardo da Vinci?

188
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:22,139
Si, but how does a painter factor into this?

189
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:26,539
He's far more than that. Bring him the pieces, you'll see.

190
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,940
Before I go, one last question, if I may?

191
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,159
Of course.

192
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,010
Why have you given your aid so readily to me, a stranger?

193
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,179
I too know betrayal.

194
00:49:16,269 --> 00:49:18,538
Oh, Ezio Auditore!

195
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,946
I… I didn't expect to see you again, what with all that's happened.

196
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:26,308
Ah, where are my manners? Welcome back!

197
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,708
Now, how can I be of service?

198
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,858
I was hoping you could repair something of mine.

199
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,592
Of course! Come! This way.

200
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,867
Ah, che pasticcio (Oh, what a mess)…

201
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:39,083
Tutto il santo giorno che cerco (I've spent the whole day looking for)…

202
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,809
Let me clear a space.

203
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,590
Alright, let's see it.

204
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:48,079
Fascinating.

205
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:50,200
I don't know, Ezio.

206
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,367
Despite its age, the construction is rather advanced.

207
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,579
I've never seen anything quite like it.

208
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:59,288
I'm afraid there's not much I can do without the original plans.

209
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,630
Mi dispiace (I'm sorry).

210
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,090
Wait, wait, wait!

211
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,291
EZIO: What are you doing?

212
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,778
The contents of this page are encrypted.

213
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,751
But if my theory is correct, based on these sketches it may very well…

214
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:15,098
It may very well what?

215
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,167
Please sit.

216
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:17,259
Leonardo, I—

217
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:18,234
Ssh, ssh, ssh!

218
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,918
Remarkable!

219
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,519
LEONARDO: If we transpose the letters, and then select every third…

220
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,539
There, it's finished!

221
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,500
Huh? What's finished?

222
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,628
The blade.

223
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,059
I managed to decode that parchment of yours.

224
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:41,429
It showed me exactly what to do.

225
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,138
Now all that's left is to remove your ring finger.

226
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:44,968
Really?

227
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:47,858
LEONARDO: I'm sorry, but this is how it must be done.

228
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,710
The blade is designed to ensure the commitment of whoever wields it.

229
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,433
Bene, do it quickly.

230
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,800
Haha, I was only having fun, Ezio.

231
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:04,090
Though the blade once required a sacrifice, it's been modified.

232
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,880
You can keep your finger.

233
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,048
Incredible!

234
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:17,900
Yes, it is. Tell me, do you have other pages like this?

235
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,710
I'm sorry, only the one.

236
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,538
Listen, if you ever do happen across another one of these, please bring it to me.

237
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,725
You have my word. And thank you for fixing this.

238
00:51:27,745 --> 00:51:32,322
OUTSIDE: By order of the Florentine guard, open this door!

239
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,400
Ehhh, just a moment.

240
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,179
Wait here.

241
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:41,775
GUARD: Are you Leonardo da Vinci?

242
00:51:41,775 --> 00:51:43,818
LEONARDO: Si. How may I be of service?

243
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,759
GUARD: I need you to answer some questions.

244
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,900
LEONARDO: Certainly.

245
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,388
What seems to be the trouble?

246
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:01,498
A witness claims to have seen you consorting with an enemy of the city.

247
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,159
What? Me? Consorting? Preposterous!

248
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:08,659
When was the last time you saw or spoke with Ezio Auditore?

249
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:09,473
Who?

250
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,760
Non fare il finto tonto (Don't play dumb with me)!

251
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:14,500
We know you were close with the family.

252
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,449
Perhaps this will help to clear your head.

253
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,670
Ready to talk?

254
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,780
What about now?

255
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:32,139
GUARD: Tell me what I want to know and we can end this.

256
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,958
LEONARDO: Grazie Ezio.

257
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,469
EZIO: Sorry about that.

258
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,638
LEONARDO: Eh, I've grown accustomed to their abuses.

259
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:55,938
EZIO: What of the body?

260
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,219
LEONARDO: Bring it inside and put it with the others.

261
00:52:58,349 --> 00:52:59,398
EZIO: Others?

262
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,769
LEONARDO: The city gives them to me, for research.

263
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,170
LEONARDO: Over there.

264
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:37,418
LEONARDO: See? Like it never happened.

265
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,500
EZIO: Thank you, Leonardo.

266
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:42,309
EZIO: For everything.

267
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:47,940
LEONARDO: Any time. And remember, if you find
more of those strange pages, bring them to me.

268
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,480
LEONARDO: Should they contain new designs I will upgrade your blade as well.

269
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,034
EZIO: Of course, now I really should be getting back to Paola.

270
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:56,880
LEONARDO: Porgile i miei omaggi (Send her my regards).
