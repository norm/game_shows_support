1
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,566
Rescuing my brothers was more than just an act of charity, Ezio.

2
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,333
The men you've freed will play a vital role in the weeks to come.

3
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,833
Just ask for their help and they'll join you.

4
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,066
EZIO: And once I have my little band of thieves?

5
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,700
Send them towards a group of guards and they'll create a distraction.

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,399
EZIO: Opening the way for me, saves me from having to bloody my sword.

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,666
Exactly!

8
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,966
Now I'll tell you what to do with them.

9
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,133
Antonio's plan calls for a bit of deception.

10
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:53,666
We're to imitate his archers, which means we'll need the armour that they wear.

11
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:59,366
A shipment of this stuff has just been loaded into chests
and now awaits delivery to Seta.

12
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:02,266
Loot the chests and retrieve the outfits.

13
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,533
When that's finished, I'll need you to
fetch me a boat as well and bring it back here.

14
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,799
We'll use it to move our men into the Palazzo undetected.

15
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,333
EZIO: Consider it done.

16
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,266
UGO: Molto bene, Ezio, this is exactly what we needed.

17
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,766
UGO: I'll let Antonio know you've finished the job.

18
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,833
ANTONIO: Please enter.

19
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,866
Your good work has restored us to our former strength, Ezio.

20
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,000
We are ready to strike.

21
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,000
Just tell me what needs to be done, and I'll see that it is.

22
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,666
You'll approach from above under the cover of night.

23
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:10,333
Emilio has posted archers around the Palazzo. Kill them, but do so quietly.

24
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,100
As they fall, my men shall replace them.

25
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
EZIO: What about the guards?

26
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,466
When you've finished with the archers,
we will regroup in front of this building here and discuss next steps.

27
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,799
EZIO: Nessun problema. I'll take care of the archers and return to you.

28
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,133
Then it's settled. In bocca al lupo (Into the wolf's mouth [good luck])!

29
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,633
Crepi il lupo (May the wolf die)!

30
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,599
Well done, Ezio. Everything is going according to plan.

31
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,366
ANTONIO: As we speak, my men are replacing the archers you've removed.

32
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,766
ANTONIO: The way to The Palazzo is clear now.

33
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:02,033
EZIO: But not the building itself, Emilio's guards still patrol its border.

34
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,700
Use my men, they can distract the guards.

35
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,166
And when it comes time to storm the place, remember what I've taught you.

36
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:15,033
Sii cauto (Take care), Ezio. We await word of your success.

37
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,033
CARLO: Your little house of cards is crumbling, Emilio.

38
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:08,033
EMILIO: A minor setback, it will be dealt with.

39
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,833
This povero scemo (poor fool) Antonio and his thieves—

40
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,833
CARLO: Never mind them, it's the Assassin you should be worried about.

41
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,366
EMILIO: Why, is–is he in Venezia?

42
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:19,500
CARLO: He's been here for weeks! How could you be so blind?

43
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,099
EMILIO: Unlike you, I've been busy.

44
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:25,133
EMILIO: Someone had to provide the weapons to our brothers in Firenze.

45
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,966
CARLO: Yes, and we all saw what good that did..

46
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:31,299
EMILIO: Enough with the barbs! What is it you want, Carlo?

47
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:35,400
CARLO: Maestro has called a meeting, three days from now at Santo Stefano.

48
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,066
EMILIO: Very well, I'll be there.

49
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,633
CARLO: Assuming you still live.

50
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:45,900
CARLO: If you want my advice, I'd find a less conspicuous place to wait.
Seta is a target now.

51
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,366
EMILIO: Seta is a fortress!

52
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,766
CARLO: If you say so. Goodbye, Emilio.

53
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,233
EMILIO: Cazzo (Fuck), what if he's right?

54
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,766
EMILIO: You! Call for my boat, it should be close.

55
00:20:55,766 --> 00:21:00,333
EMILIO: When it arrives load those crates and prepare to sail.
I'll be right back.

56
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:05,733
EMILIO: If Carlo speaks true, I must find a place to hide,
just until the meeting.

57
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,333
EMILIO: Then we'll deal with the Assassin.

58
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,533
EMILIO: He must be working with Antonio.

59
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,233
EMILIO: That means the attacks…

60
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,633
EMILIO: No! I've worked too hard for this.

61
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,933
EMILIO: Don't they understand?

62
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:54,866
EMILIO: There's so much less crime, the people have better lives!

63
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:57,900
EMILIO: So some must leave, it is the price of progress.

64
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,900
EMILIO: Why must the Assassins always interfere, like Giovanni?

65
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,933
EMILIO: If he had just left well enough alone.

66
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,166
EMILIO: Guardia! Guardia!

67
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:27,733
SHAUN: Emilio Barbarigo. Titan of Venetian industry, terror of the underworld.

68
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:32,799
SHAUN: Aided by his powerful family,
he cornered the market through smart business practises,

69
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,000
SHAUN: …such as edging out the competition and lobbying the government.

70
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,666
SHAUN: He funded the Venetian police force almost single-handedly.

71
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:45,066
SHAUN: Keeping the streets safe from crime and his finances tax free.

72
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:48,000
SHAUN: Emilio claims to be a supporter of the Republic.

73
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,366
SHAUN: The problem is, once you own the police force,
voting becomes, well… inefficient.

74
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:56,799
SHAUN: As does, you know, opposition.

75
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,066
EZIO: Do not be afraid.

76
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,900
EMILIO: I feel no fear, Assassin, only regret.

77
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:10,833
EMILIO: I sought unity, stability, order.

78
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,733
EZIO: At too great a cost.

79
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,066
EMILIO: Progress demands sacrifice.

80
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:22,766
EZIO: Non trovo alcuna gioia in questo, ma non c'e altro modo
(I take no joy in this, but I see no other way).

81
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,166
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

82
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,900
Sorry, they couldn't resist.

83
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,066
Seta is fallen and Emilio is no more.

84
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,366
All thanks to you, Ezio.

85
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:53,099
Go! Tear down Emilio's banners.

86
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,400
Return what he has stolen from the people.

87
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:05,000
Tell me, Ezio, how can I repay you for your service?

88
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,633
EZIO: Money's always nice.

89
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,033
ANTONIO: Easy enough.

90
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,900
ANTONIO: What else?

91
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:15,133
Emilio was meeting with a man named Carlo.

92
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,299
He looked to be a government official. Do you know him?

93
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,799
Carlo Grimaldi. He sits on the Council of Ten.

94
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,700
Why do you ask, what are you up to?

95
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,833
I have a meeting to attend.

96
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,200
SILVIO: Where is Emilio?

97
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,099
CARLO: I told him to be here.

98
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,033
You told him yourself? In person?

99
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,599
Yes, myself in person.

100
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,133
I'm concerned that you don't trust me.

101
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:21,400
As am I.

102
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,200
Perhaps he'll arrive with the others.

103
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:26,266
Walk with me.

104
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:38,366
SILVIO: So, how go things in the palace?

105
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,599
CARLO: Honestly, it's difficult.

106
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,966
CARLO: Mocenigo keeps his circle close.

107
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:49,766
CARLO: I've tried to lay the groundwork, making suggestions,
but he has other voices at his ears.

108
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:53,266
SILVIO: Then you must work hard, you must become part of his inner circle.

109
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:57,766
CARLO: Si, I understand, but it's harder than I expected.

110
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:59,633
SILVIO: And why is that, Carlo?

111
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,833
CARLO: I don't know! He just…

112
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:04,400
CARLO: The Doge doesn't like me.

113
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,133
SILVIO: I wonder why.

114
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,633
CARLO: It's not my fault! I keep trying to please him.

115
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:14,033
CARLO: I learn what he craves and I have it delivered.

116
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,900
CARLO: The finest jams from the orchards of Sardinia.

117
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,833
CARLO: The newest fashions from Milano.

118
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,799
SILVIO: Yes, and that's called being a sycophant.

119
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,133
CARLO: A what? What did you call me?!

120
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,433
SILVIO: A doormat. A flatterer. A bootlicker!

121
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,933
CARLO: Need I go on?

122
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,200
CARLO: Bastardo! You don't know what it's like.

123
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,466
CARLO: You don't understand the pressure in there.

124
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,466
SILVIO: Oh, I don't understand pressure?!

125
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,400
CARLO: No, you have no idea!

126
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,500
CARLO: You are a government official!

127
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,099
CARLO: I am two steps from the Doge himself!

128
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,500
CARLO: I am beside him day and night!

129
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,866
CARLO: You wish you could be where I am!

130
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,333
SILVIO: Are you done?

131
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,833
CARLO: Hardly! You listen to me now.

132
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:04,700
CARLO: I am close. The Doge can be recruited to our cause, I am sure of it!

133
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,433
CARLO: I just… I need a little more time.

134
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,700
SILVIO: Time is not a thing we have in great supply.

135
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:35,633
CARLO: My feet are killing me! Can we sit down inside somewhere?

136
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:39,633
SILVIO: Do you know anywhere truly safe to discuss things such as these?

137
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,266
MARCO: Buon giorno (Good day), cousin. Signor Carlo.

138
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,966
We thought Emilio would be with you.

139
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,400
MARCO: Emilio is dead.

140
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,833
What?! How?

141
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,900
The Assassin! The same one who hunted down the Pazzi. He's here, in Venezia.

142
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,000
MARCO:  È così (It is so). Silvio, did you not know?

143
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:21,433
CARLO: He could be anywhere.
He could be here right now and we might not even know.

144
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,366
He struck Emilio inside his own palazzo.

145
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,633
And so, what of our plans?

146
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:32,066
There is no longer time for subtlety, my brothers. We must act now.

147
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,966
But Marco, I'm so close. A few more days. If I can just—

148
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,833
No! It happens this week.

149
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,033
DANTE: We should keep moving.

150
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:45,233
SILVIO: What does the Spaniard have to say to this change of plan?

151
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,066
MARCO: You can ask him yourself soon enough.

152
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,333
CARLO: He's here? From Roma?

153
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,799
MARCO: So I've heard.

154
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,599
SILVIO: Good, then perhaps he's made a decision.

155
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,500
MARCO: About what, cousin?

156
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,966
SILVIO: About which of us shall step into the role of the Doge.

157
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:10,166
MARCO: I didn't know there was a decision to be made.

158
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:13,366
MARCO: Surely the choice is obvious to all.

159
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:18,333
SILVIO: Obvious indeed. It should be the one who organised the entire operation.

160
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:22,200
SILVIO: The one who came up with the idea of how to save this city.

161
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,566
MARCO: There is no lack of value in tactical intelligence, good Silvio.

162
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:34,766
MARCO: But it is wisdom one needs to rule, do not think otherwise.

163
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,500
CARLO: Calma, calma, amici (calm, calm, friends). There is no need for this.

164
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,700
CARLO: You know it's not up to either of you.

165
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,633
CARLO: For all we know, he may not even choose a Barbarigo.

166
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:49,633
MARCO, SILVIO: [laugh]

167
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,633
CARLO: Why not me? I'm the one who's done all the hard work!

168
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,133
MARCO: Basta (Enough)! We wait for his arrival.

169
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,000
CARLO: Are you sure he's coming?

170
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,666
MARCO: Yes!

171
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:12,000
DANTE: Signori, we should move a little faster. I feel eyes on us.

172
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,766
MARCO: Thank you, Dante. We will move at your pace.

173
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,066
SILVIO: This guard's a good find, cousin. How much did you pay for him?

174
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,500
MARCO: Perhaps not as much as he deserves.

175
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,933
MARCO: He's saved my life on two occasions.

176
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:30,566
MARCO: Though he's not much of a conversationalist.

177
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,700
Enough with your inane prattle!

178
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,633
The choice of Doge was never up to any of you.

179
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:40,299
And you were never given permission to make plans.

180
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,366
Forgive us, Maestro, we wish only to serve.

181
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,433
The plan is this.

182
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,700
Doge Mocenigo will die tonight.

183
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:56,766
And once the deed's been done Marco shall take his place.

184
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,700
Vi ringrazio umilmente, Maestro
(I humbly thank you, Master).


185
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,500
Good! Messer Grimaldi…

186
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:09,966
RODRIGO: You are closest to Mocenigo, your work the most vital.

187
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:14,533
Serve us well and it won't be forgotten.

188
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,333
RODRIGO: Walk with me.

189
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,633
RODRIGO: I don't want any blood spilled, you understand?

190
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
RODRIGO: It must appear to all that he goes quietly.

191
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,700
CARLO: Certo (Of course), Maestro.

192
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,633
RODRIGO: When are you closest to him?

193
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,700
CARLO: I have full run of the palace.

194
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,866
CARLO: He may not care to hear what I have to say,
but he trusts me by now as one of his own.

195
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:46,799
RODRIGO: Bravo. Then I want you to infiltrate the kitchen and poison his meal.

196
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:48,533
CARLO: So be it.

197
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,900
RODRIGO: Marco, can you furnish us with a suitable toxin on short notice?

198
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,333
MARCO: I defer to my cousin. That is really his area of expertise.

199
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:02,633
RODRIGO: Silvio?

200
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,433
SILVIO: I am at your service, Maestro.

201
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,433
RODRIGO: What can you bring to get this done?

202
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,433
SILVIO: I will confer with my associates in the streets.

203
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:15,300
SILVIO: But chances are good that I could procure some Cantarella.

204
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,966
RODRIGO: Yes, and what is that?

205
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:25,666
SILVIO: It is a most effective form of arsenic, yet difficult to trace.

206
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,233
RODRIGO: Ah, va bene, va bene, then it's decided.

207
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:22,833
MARCO: Forgive me, Maestro, but is this not perhaps a tad dangerous for you?

208
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:27,199
Involving yourself so intimately with the minutiae of our plans?

209
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,733
I feel the need to involve myself more directly.

210
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,800
The Pazzi disappointed us in Firenze.

211
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,300
I pray you will not do the same.

212
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:40,866
Do not worry this time. The Pazzi were a bunch of foolish—

213
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:47,333
Pazzis were a potent and venerable family,
reduced to rubble by one young Assassin.

214
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:53,166
Do not underestimate this troublesome foe who now haunts your city.

215
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:58,300
Or the same fate will befall the Barbarigo.

216
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,966
I want this done promptly.

217
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,199
Bene, I must return to Roma.

218
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,533
RODRIGO: Time is of the essence.

219
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,966
RODRIGO: Do not fail us.

220
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:21,766
Che idiota sono (What an idiot I am)! I should have kept my eyes on them.

221
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,933
I need to go and see Antonio if I have any hope of salvaging this mess I've made.

222
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,266
Salute, bello mio (Hello beautiful). Come stai (How are you)?

223
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,033
You back to see me, already?

224
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,800
Desolato, mia cara (Sorry, my dear), but I am not here to play.

225
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,733
I must speak with Antonio, it's urgent.

226
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,300
Antonio! Ezio's here!

227
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,300
Ezio, is everything alright?

228
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,633
Carlo Grimaldi and the Barbarigo
are in league with the one they call the Spaniard.

229
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:44,199
They're going to murder the Doge and replace him with one of their own.

230
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,800
They would have all of Venezia, her entire fleet in their grasp.

231
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,566
And they call me a criminal!

232
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:50,733
EZIO: Then you'll help me?

233
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:54,366
You have me on your side, brother, and the support of all my men.

234
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:55,300
And women.

235
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,666
Grazie, amici.

236
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:59,466
ANTONIO: But, Ezio, I must warn you.

237
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:02,133
It's not going to be so easy this time.

238
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:05,466
Palazzo Ducale is the most heavily guarded building in Venezia.

239
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,033
Nothing is impenetrable.

240
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:11,066
[laughs] This is why we like you, Ezio.

241
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:14,199
ANTONIO: Come, let's go take a look, we'll come up with a plan.

242
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,666
ANTONIO: This business with the Doge, terrible.

243
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:27,666
ANTONIO: Though treachery like this no longer surprises me.

244
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:31,833
ANTONIO: When I was a child, we were taught that the nobles were just and kind.

245
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,000
ANTONIO: I believed it.

246
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,366
ANTONIO: Though my father was only a cobbler, and my mother a scullery maid,
I aspired to be much more.

247
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:42,900
ANTONIO: I studied hard, I persevered, but the nobles would never have me.

248
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:46,533
ANTONIO: If you are not born one of them, acceptance is impossible.

249
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:51,166
ANTONIO: So I ask you, Ezio, who are the true nobles of Venezia?

250
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:55,266
ANTONIO: Men like Carlo Grimaldi and Marco Barbarigo? No!

251
00:42:55,266 --> 00:43:00,633
ANTONIO: I say we are, the thieves and mercenari and whores.

252
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:07,066
ANTONIO: While we work to save this city and its people,
the nobles seek to make it their plaything.

253
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:32,533
ANTONIO: We need to scout the Palazzo carefully, see it from every angle.

254
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,300
ANTONIO: We just might find a way in.

255
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:37,366
ANTONIO: I know of a tall campanile behind the palazzo.

256
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:40,300
ANTONIO: Or we might find a way to climb the back of the basilica.

257
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,266
ANTONIO: Do you have any ideas?

258
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,599
EZIO: I assume the front door is out.

259
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:49,699
ANTONIO: [laughs] Va bene, we'll try the front door as well, saputello (wise ass).

260
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,233
EZIO: So, what do you think?

261
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:23,966
ANTONIO: We're not getting in this way.

262
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:28,199
ANTONIO: They'll have time to murder the Doge
before we're able to get through all these guards.

263
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:09,266
ANTONIO: Look at that, archers everywhere.

264
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,933
EZIO: And the walls are impossible to climb on this side.

265
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:54,466
ANTONIO: Bene, we're in luck.

266
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:58,699
ANTONIO: Looks like there's a perfect path
up the scaffolding to the roof of the basilica.

267
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,966
ANTONIO: Shall we?

268
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,166
ANTONIO: Ezio, look! Isn't that him? Grimaldi?

269
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,233
CARLO: Don't you understand what I'm offering you, Signore?

270
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:16,066
CARLO: Listen to me, please.

271
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:19,233
CARLO: Or this will be your last chance.

272
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,599
DOGE: How dare you?

273
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:23,933
CARLO: I'm sorry, mi dispiace (I'm sorry).

274
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:27,233
CARLO: I meant nothing by it, I'm only looking out for your safety.

275
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:32,666
ANTONIO: We're running out of time. There's no way through this fence,
and there are guards everywhere! Diavolo!

276
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,833
It's impossible.

277
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:40,400
There's no way in or out for men, only birds.

278
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,000
Yes, birds!

279
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,133
ANTONIO: Where are you going now?

280
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:46,333
EZIO: To see my friend Leonardo!

281
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,633
EZIO: I need your help, Leonardo.

282
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:24,666
EZIO: Does it work?
LEONARDO: What? What are you asking?
