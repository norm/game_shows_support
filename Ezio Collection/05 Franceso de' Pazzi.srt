1
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:48,133
ILARIO: How long do we have to stand here, Saverio? It's so 
cold!

2
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,966
SAVERIO: What do you want, Ilario?

3
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:55,600
SAVERIO: Messer Pazzi is paying us good money to watch the 
entrance, and the dead won't try to murder us!

4
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,366
SAVERIO: I can't wait to go home to Elena and tell her how 
much gold we made tonight!

5
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,933
SAVERIO: Merda (Shit)! The door.

6
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,233
SAVERIO: Keep watch while I go look.

7
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,600
SAVERIO: This was supposed to be an easy job.

8
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,366
ILARIO: I told you we shouldn't have come here!

9
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,666
ILARIO: If I hear anything, I'm running to the other guard 
post, so help me God.

10
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
ILARIO: Saverio! I'll be back with the other guards!

11
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,899
ILARIO: Have to find a way out, before he kills me.

12
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,299
ILARIO: Yes, yes, I think I got away.

13
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,700
ILARIO: Leave me alone!

14
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,333
ILARIO: Run faster!

15
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:46,966
ILARIO: Have to find a way out, before he kills me.

16
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,700
ILARIO: He's not going to get me.

17
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:02,399
ILARIO: Yes, yes, I think I got away.

18
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,733
ILARIO: Leave me alone!

19
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,233
ILARIO: Leave me alone!

20
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,833
ILARIO: I'm being chased! Get him!

21
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,833
STEFANO: Et benedictio Dei omnipotentis (And may the 
blessing of Almighty God)

22
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,233
STEFANO: Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti (the Father and 
of the Son and Holy Spirit)

23
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:21,866
STEFANO: descendat super vos et maneat semper (descend upon 
you, and remain with you always).


24
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:26,133
FRANCESCO: Grazie, Padre. Bernardo?

25
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,866
BERNARDO: It's all here: swords, staves, axes, armour, bows.

26
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,933
Our men will want for nothing.

27
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,100
STEFANO: I take this gift to mean the Pope consents?

28
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,066
SPANIARD: He gave his blessing to the operation…

29
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,133
…as long as nobody's killed.

30
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:46,133
FRANCESCO: We're all set for the Duomo or in the morning, 
Signore.

31
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,666
The bait's been laid, but it wasn't easy.

32
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,933
His fool brother keeps changing his plans.

33
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:57,399
Sì! We'll need to be on hand to make sure Giuliano even gets
 out of bed for church tomorrow!

34
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,899
RODRIGO: What is it, Jacopo? Do you think they suspect 
something?

35
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,133
FRANCESCO: Impossible! The Medici are too arrogant, or too 
stupid to even notice.

36
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,133
Likely a bit of both.

37
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,366
Do not underestimate our enemies, Francesco.

38
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:16,966
Or have you already forgotten how your son was murdered?

39
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:22,866
We'll suffer no such surprises this time, Maestro, you have 
my word.

40
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,066
Molto bene (Very well), I should be off.

41
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,566
I have some other business to attend to before I return to 
Rome.

42
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:36,200
Gentlemen, tomorrow a new sun rises over Firenze.

43
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:39,433
RODRIGO: May the Father of Understanding guide us.

44
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,433
ALL: May the Father of Understanding guide us.

45
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,766
SHAUN: Look at that statue.

46
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,833
SHAUN: It's identical to one in the Villa Auditore.

47
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:03,166
SHAUN: I think you've stumbled onto one of the Assassins 
Tombs Ezio's uncle mentioned.

48
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,866
REBECCA: Now that we know the way in, I'll tag the landmarks
 containing tombs in the database.

49
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,766
EZIO: I know where Francesco will be, and when, but…

50
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,033
VOLPE: What is it?

51
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,633
I overheard something.

52
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,633
They have weapons, enough for a battalion.

53
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,766
Even the Pope has given support.

54
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:06,833
Hmm, typical of Sixtus, but…

55
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,466
What the hell are they planning?

56
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:14,133
I couldn't understand the specifics, but it involves the 
Medici.

57
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,133
And it begins tomorrow morning at the Duomo.

58
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,400
The Medici will all be there for Sunday service.

59
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,166
Along with the rest of Firenze!

60
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,133
They're going to do it right in the middle of High Mass!

61
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,466
But it's also a chance for me to blend with the crowd, get 
close and stop this madness.

62
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:36,566
If they succeed, if we lose Lorenzo, and Firenze falls to 
the Pazzi…

63
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:39,299
It will not come to that, I promise.

64
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,533
I hope you are right.

65
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,133
EZIO: There's Lorenzo and his wife.

66
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,666
That's Giuliano, Lorenzo's brother.

67
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,299
EZIO: But where is Francesco?

68
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,766
EZIO: There he is. Time to strike.

69
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,133
Crepa, traditore (Here, traitor)!


70
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,366
Giuliano, no!

71
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,366
No! In nome di Dio (In the name of God)!

72
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,166
Vi scongiuro, pìetà! (I beg you, mercy!)

73
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,799
Nessuna pìetà, cane maledetto (No mercy for you, dog)!


74
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,033
Muori (Die)! Muori!

75
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,633
MUORI!

76
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,266
Your day is done, Lorenzo.

77
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:37,900
Your entire family dies by my sword!

78
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,766
You … saved my life.

79
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:56,633
It's nothing, but the man who did this to you has to pay.

80
00:29:56,633 --> 00:30:00,500
Aah! Not now. I need help first.

81
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,400
To my home, people I trust there.

82
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,200
C–Can you…?

83
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,299
LORENZO: I'm losing a lot of blood.

84
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:20,533
Hang on, Signore! I'm moving as fast as I can.

85
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,066
LORENZO: Francesco de' Pazzi! I'll kill him!

86
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,666
LORENZO: I'll wipe his entire family from the city!

87
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,400
LORENZO: They'll be erased!

88
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,333
EZIO: Quietatevi, Signore (Be still, sir).

89
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,333
EZIO: Conserve your energy, or I'll be delivering a corpse.

90
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,400
EZIO: We're almost there, now.

91
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Lorenzo's been wounded! Aprite la porta (Open the door)!

92
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,200
What's the password?

93
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,766
Poliziano! Open the maledetta porta (fucking door)!


94
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,966
By the Thrice Greatest! Come in, quickly!

95
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,233
The city is at war! Hurry!


96
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,533
Wait!

97
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,200
I am in your debt.

98
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,833
Tell me, why did you help me?

99
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:03,433
You are not the only one who lost a brother to the Pazzi.

100
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,733
My name is Ezio Auditore.

101
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,500
Aah. You're Giovanni's son.

102
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,633
Your father was a good man.

103
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,299
He understood honour, loyalty…

104
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,766
The Pazzi thugs are storming the Palazzo Della Signoria!

105
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,366
We cannot hold them off much longer!

106
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,533
POLIZIANO: No! If they get inside they'll murder our 
supporters!

107
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,533
And put their own devils in power!

108
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,633
Then my survival would mean nothing.

109
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,033
I have to…

110
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,299
Francesco de' Pazzi!

111
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,833
Help save our city, Auditore!

112
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,933
Kill him!

113
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:04,133
Signore, I saw Francesco lead a battalion around the back of
 the Palazzo Della Signoria.

114
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,799
I fear he may be seeking another way in.

115
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,633
Go before it's too late, do what you can!

116
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,133
You again? Why aren't you dead? Men, slaughter him!

117
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:03,599
FRANCESCO: Oh, the boy thinks himself a master swordsman.

118
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,433
FRANCESCO: So you've drawn some blood! My men will make 
short work of you!

119
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,933
FRANCESCO: Desisti (Stop)!

120
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:15,233
FRANCESCO: You're only delaying your inevitable, painful 
end.

121
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,000
FRANCESCO: What do you think you're proving?

122
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,300
FRANCESCO: That you're a loyal servant to that dog, Lorenzo?

123
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,333
FRANCESCO: Death shall be your reward.

124
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,666
FRANCESCO: I grow tired of this game. Guards, finitelo 
(finish him off)!


125
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,633
Guards! GUARDS!

126
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,233
EZIO: No-one's coming.

127
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,366
EZIO: It's just us now.

128
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:55,699
Maledetto (Damn you)! Che il diavolo ti porti (Damn you to 
hell)!

129
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,699
Stammi lontano (Get away from me!)


130
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:48,400
SHAUN: Francesco de' Pazzi.

131
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,166
SHAUN: Brought up as a noble in a city captivated by the 
newly rich Medici family.

132
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:57,866
SHAUN: Francesco was taught to hate the middle class and its
 social climbers.

133
00:40:57,866 --> 00:41:01,233
SHAUN: Dismayed, he watched as the Medici bank eclipsed his 
own.

134
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:05,500
SHAUN: And centuries of influence over the Florentine 
government slipped away.

135
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,633
SHAUN: It looks like the Spaniard offered him a solution.

136
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,066
SHAUN: Rather than compete in something as dirty as banking.

137
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,966
SHAUN: Francesco only had to do one thing for the Templars.

138
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:17,233
SHAUN: One thing to put the middle class in their place for 
good.

139
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,966
SHAUN: Kill the Medici.

140
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:24,199
SHAUN: Giovanni Auditore tryied to stop Francesco by putting
 him in jail.

141
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,699
SHAUN: But the Templars took care of that.

142
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:31,500
EZIO: Now Firenze  will judge you for what you've done.

143
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,000
FRANCESCO: It's over, it's all over.

144
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,933
EZIO: Meglio essere felici in questa vita (Better to be 
content in this life)…

145
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:48,366
EZIO: …che aspirare a esserlo nella prossima (than aspire to
 it in the next).

146
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,699
EZIO: Requiescat in pace (Rest in peace).

147
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:57,133
CROWD: Libertà (Liberty)! Libertà! Libertà! Libertà!

148
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:02,599
JACOPO: Libertà! Libertà! Libertà!

149
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:05,199
Popolo e libertà (People and liberty)!

150
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,766
CROWD: Libertà (Liberty)! Libertà! Libertà!

151
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:12,766
Francesco?

152
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:26,233
When I was six years old, I fell into the Arno.

153
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:30,933
I soon found myself drifting down and into darkness.

154
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,766
Certain my life was at an end.

155
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:39,599
Instead, I woke to the sound of my mother weeping. 

156
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:46,599
At her side stood a stranger, soaking, and smiling at me.

157
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,733
My mother explained that he had saved me.

158
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:57,699
And so began a long and prosperous relationship between two 
families.

159
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,566
Yours, and mine.

160
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:06,133
I am sorry I could not save your father and brothers.

161
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,766
EZIO: You have nothing to apologise for.

162
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:12,633
EZIO: I believe Jacopo de' Pazzi played a part in their 
deaths.

163
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,300
EZIO: The attack on you as well.

164
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,133
I need to find him.

165
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,633
That coward fled before we could arrest him.

166
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:19,933
Have you any leads?

167
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:22,199
LORENZO: No, they've hidden themselves well.

168
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,000
"They"?

169
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,766
LORENZO: Jacopo was not the only conspirator to escape.

170
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:32,266
If they work with Jacopo, they were surely involved in the 
plot against my family as well.

171
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,366
Give me their names.

172
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,366
Antonio Maffei.

173
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:39,366
Archbishop Francesco Salviati.

174
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,566
Stefano da Bagnone.

175
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,333
And Bernardo Baroncelli.

176
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,300
Bene, I will go and see my uncle.

177
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,833
He has men stationed in the countryside.

178
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:51,500
Wait, before you go…

179
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,066
EZIO: A Codex page!

180
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,066
I took it from the files of Francesco de' Pazzi.

181
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:00,500
Seeing as he clearly no longer needs it.

182
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,566
I've always had an interest in things of antiquity.

183
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:07,866
As did your father.

184
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:09,900
EZIO: It is meaningful to me as well.

185
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,666
Then consider it a gift!

186
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,566
Che il Signore ci protegga (God save us all).


187
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,933
REBECCA: I've marched the Palazzo Medici on your map.

188
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:05,599
REBECCA: In order to achieve 100% sync with Ezio's life, you
 should go explore it.

189
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,033
Ezio! Thank God you're alright.

190
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:53,599
This madness with the Medici and the Pazzi.

191
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,466
Is this why you pursued Francesco?

192
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:56,699
Not exactly.

193
00:52:57,166 --> 00:53:00,733
Well, whatever your reasons, the city's safe again, thanks 
to you.

194
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:03,199
Now tell me, how may I be of service?

195
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:06,000
Ah, another page.

196
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:10,733
Aha, it's a similar cypher to the last one.

197
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,199
This won't take long.

198
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,199
Interesting.

199
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:18,666
Ohh, indeed, I see…

200
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:23,066
It's another blade design, for delivering poison.

201
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,833
Can you build it?

202
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,733
Si, it won't take very long.

203
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:31,099
I just need to find a way to hollow out the blade without 
sacrificing the…

204
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,266
It's alright, Leonardo, just do what you need to do.

205
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:43,466
All done.

206
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,166
I filled your blade with a bit of poison to start with.

207
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:49,300
Should you run out just visit a doctor.

208
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,699
Poison, from a doctor?

209
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:55,533
In high enough doses that which cures can kill.

210
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,500
I am in your debt once more, my friend.

211
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,000
Any time, Ezio, any time.
