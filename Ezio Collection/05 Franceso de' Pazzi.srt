1
0:00:06,540 --> 0:00:07,120
Yeah.

2
0:00:41,240 --> 0:00:41,799
Hey,

3
0:00:44,939 --> 0:00:45,500
No.

4
0:01:08,969 --> 0:01:09,680
Okay,

5
0:01:45,640 --> 0:01:46,260
okay.

6
0:02:15,740 --> 0:02:16,300
Yeah.

7
0:03:30,740 --> 0:03:31,419
All right.

8
0:03:32,349 --> 0:03:32,960
Yeah,

9
0:03:54,419 --> 0:03:55,139
Yeah.

10
0:04:14,939 --> 0:04:15,560
What?

11
0:04:38,939 --> 0:04:39,579
Okay.

12
0:05:23,240 --> 0:05:23,949
No.

13
0:05:44,139 --> 0:05:45,849
How long do we have to stand here?

14
0:05:45,850 --> 0:05:46,980
Survey area.

15
0:05:47,120 --> 0:05:48,149
Its so called.

16
0:05:48,149 --> 0:05:48,959
What do you want?

17
0:05:48,959 --> 0:05:55,750
Ilario May said Patsy is paying us good money to watch the entrance, and the dead won't try to murder us.

18
0:05:55,959 --> 0:05:57,669
I can't wait to go home to Ellen.

19
0:05:57,670 --> 0:06:00,050
And how much gold we made?

20
0:06:54,040 --> 0:06:54,600
Yeah,

21
0:07:18,740 --> 0:07:19,300
yeah,

22
0:07:33,540 --> 0:07:34,100
yeah,

23
0:07:40,360 --> 0:07:41,100
yeah,

24
0:07:56,060 --> 0:07:56,750
yeah.

25
0:07:59,439 --> 0:08:00,029
Okay.

26
0:08:11,300 --> 0:08:11,930
Yes,

27
0:08:29,839 --> 0:08:30,550
but

28
0:08:31,949 --> 0:08:32,549
right.

29
0:08:42,139 --> 0:08:42,700
No,

30
0:09:22,139 --> 0:09:22,950
thank you.

31
0:09:50,139 --> 0:09:50,850
Okay.

32
0:09:52,039 --> 0:09:52,750
What?

33
0:10:11,179 --> 0:10:11,740
Yeah,

34
0:10:25,159 --> 0:10:26,990
after the door.

35
0:10:27,539 --> 0:10:28,629
Keep watch while I go.

36
0:10:28,629 --> 0:10:29,590
Look,

37
0:10:30,240 --> 0:10:32,750
it was supposed to be an easy job.

38
0:10:33,289 --> 0:10:35,519
I told you we shouldn't have come here.

39
0:10:35,519 --> 0:10:39,820
If I hear anything, I'm a running through the other guard post, so help me God.

40
0:11:02,340 --> 0:11:02,899
Yeah,

41
0:11:42,740 --> 0:11:44,490
I've seen him before,

42
0:11:56,549 --> 0:11:56,839
sir.

43
0:11:56,840 --> 0:11:57,178
Very.

44
0:11:57,179 --> 0:11:59,759
Oh, I'll be back with the other guards

45
0:12:03,429 --> 0:12:07,519
to find you're way off before it kills me.

46
0:12:11,039 --> 0:12:13,079
Yes, yes.

47
0:12:13,080 --> 0:12:18,350
I don't loathe.

48
0:12:23,549 --> 0:12:25,210
Leave me alone.

49
0:12:30,580 --> 0:12:31,830
Run faster.

50
0:12:32,340 --> 0:12:32,899
Yeah.

51
0:12:34,340 --> 0:12:34,899
No.

52
0:12:37,539 --> 0:12:38,100
Yeah.

53
0:12:44,440 --> 0:12:47,649
Wait.

54
0:12:53,539 --> 0:12:55,460
He's not going to get me.

55
0:13:00,639 --> 0:13:01,440
Thanks.

56
0:13:05,779 --> 0:13:07,450
Leave me alone.

57
0:13:26,230 --> 0:13:27,909
Leave me alone.

58
0:13:32,720 --> 0:13:35,350
I'm being chased him.

59
0:13:38,639 --> 0:13:39,200
No.

60
0:13:41,740 --> 0:13:42,350
Okay.

61
0:13:52,419 --> 0:13:53,000
Yeah.

62
0:13:57,129 --> 0:13:58,049
You

63
0:14:01,259 --> 0:14:02,750
get it.

64
0:14:10,490 --> 0:14:11,299
Oh,

65
0:14:15,870 --> 0:14:16,830
Dr.

66
0:14:19,059 --> 0:14:19,528
Right.

67
0:14:19,529 --> 0:14:21,159
Or like

68
0:14:27,740 --> 0:14:28,299
no.

69
0:14:40,840 --> 0:14:41,399
Yeah,

70
0:14:44,240 --> 0:14:44,799
yeah.

71
0:15:12,759 --> 0:15:22,000
Benedict, Your day in the portentous batteries That filly spirit to sank Shane, that super vos that money at

72
0:15:23,779 --> 0:15:24,879
That's bad.

73
0:15:25,639 --> 0:15:33,470
But now it's all here Sort staves, axes, armour bows Our men will want for nothing.

74
0:15:33,519 --> 0:15:37,110
I take this gift to mean the pope consents.

75
0:15:37,840 --> 0:15:40,179
He gave his blessing to the operation

76
0:15:40,799 --> 0:15:43,149
as long as nobody skilled

77
0:15:43,940 --> 0:15:46,820
We're all set for the warm or in the mornings and yawning.

78
0:15:47,120 --> 0:15:49,509
Bate's been laid but it wasn't easy.

79
0:15:49,509 --> 0:15:52,418
His full brother keeps changing his plans.

80
0:15:52,419 --> 0:15:57,889
See, we need to be on hand to make sure Giuliana even gets out of bed for church tomorrow.

81
0:15:59,500 --> 0:16:00,058
What is it?

82
0:16:00,059 --> 0:16:01,149
Deductible?

83
0:16:01,440 --> 0:16:03,408
Do you think they suspect something?

84
0:16:03,409 --> 0:16:04,459
Impossible.

85
0:16:04,460 --> 0:16:06,168
The Medici are two out again.

86
0:16:06,169 --> 0:16:08,620
Too stupid to even notice.

87
0:16:08,779 --> 0:16:10,649
Likely A bit of both.

88
0:16:10,720 --> 0:16:12,469
Do not underestimate our enemies.

89
0:16:12,470 --> 0:16:17,450
Francesco, Have you already forgotten how your son was murdered?

90
0:16:18,440 --> 0:16:20,629
We'll suffer no such surprises this time.

91
0:16:20,629 --> 0:16:23,350
Maestro, you have my word,

92
0:16:24,059 --> 0:16:24,980
Multiple.

93
0:16:25,080 --> 0:16:26,580
I should be off.

94
0:16:26,690 --> 0:16:30,070
Have some other business to attend to before return to Rome.

95
0:16:30,960 --> 0:16:36,690
Gentlemen, tomorrow a new sun rises over France.

96
0:16:37,309 --> 0:16:40,419
May the father of understanding guide us

97
0:16:59,059 --> 0:16:59,710
me.

98
0:17:01,840 --> 0:17:03,389
Look at that statue.

99
0:17:03,389 --> 0:17:05,379
It's identical to one in the villa out.

100
0:17:05,380 --> 0:17:06,470
A Tory.

101
0:17:06,509 --> 0:17:10,809
I think you've stumbled onto one of the assassins two's uncle mentioned.

102
0:17:16,940 --> 0:17:21,509
Now that we know the way in, I'll tag the landmarks containing tombs in the database.

103
0:17:25,339 --> 0:17:25,960
Yeah,

104
0:17:54,940 --> 0:17:55,690
all right.

105
0:18:11,140 --> 0:18:11,750
Oh,

106
0:18:24,640 --> 0:18:25,269
what?

107
0:18:33,539 --> 0:18:34,099
Yeah,

108
0:18:55,240 --> 0:18:55,829
Okay.

109
0:18:59,640 --> 0:19:01,149
Nowhere Francesco will be.

110
0:19:01,150 --> 0:19:03,349
And when act.

111
0:19:03,619 --> 0:19:04,538
What is it?

112
0:19:04,539 --> 0:19:06,259
I overheard something.

113
0:19:06,589 --> 0:19:09,259
They have weapons enough for a battalion.

114
0:19:09,430 --> 0:19:13,459
Even the pope has given support typical of sisters.

115
0:19:13,460 --> 0:19:14,470
But

116
0:19:15,740 --> 0:19:17,950
what the hell are they planning?

117
0:19:17,990 --> 0:19:23,759
I couldn't understand the specifics, but it involves the Medici, and it begins tomorrow morning at the drama.

118
0:19:23,759 --> 0:19:24,288
The maid.

119
0:19:24,289 --> 0:19:27,049
She will always be there for Sunday's service,

120
0:19:28,140 --> 0:19:29,709
along with the rest of Fillon.

121
0:19:29,710 --> 0:19:33,759
Say they're going to do it right in the middle of high Mass.

122
0:19:33,839 --> 0:19:41,679
But it's also a chance for me to blend with the crowd, get close and stop this madness if they succeed, if we lose Lawrence.

123
0:19:41,680 --> 0:19:45,769
Oh, and fear in, say, falls to the party will not come to that.

124
0:19:45,890 --> 0:19:46,949
A promise.

125
0:19:46,950 --> 0:19:49,170
I hope you are, right.

126
0:19:52,539 --> 0:19:53,140
What?

127
0:20:41,240 --> 0:20:41,799
No.

128
0:20:45,240 --> 0:20:45,849
Oh,

129
0:21:04,140 --> 0:21:04,920
yeah.

130
0:21:17,440 --> 0:21:18,059
What?

131
0:21:33,589 --> 0:21:34,220
Yeah.

132
0:21:52,339 --> 0:21:52,910
Hey,

133
0:21:53,839 --> 0:21:55,619
and I just see that

134
0:21:56,210 --> 0:21:58,049
I must be working toe.

135
0:22:00,339 --> 0:22:02,150
Well, please be careful.

136
0:22:09,700 --> 0:22:10,329
What?

137
0:22:10,710 --> 0:22:11,349
No.

138
0:22:11,819 --> 0:22:12,538
Have you been?

139
0:22:12,539 --> 0:22:13,099
Yeah.

140
0:22:13,539 --> 0:22:14,349
Who?

141
0:22:18,490 --> 0:22:23,749
You may be the big man wherever you come from, but here you're just a bit.

142
0:22:23,750 --> 0:22:24,990
Sort the mail.

143
0:22:29,500 --> 0:22:32,329
Amusing yourself in our first cities.

144
0:22:32,569 --> 0:22:33,859
You're finished?

145
0:22:49,240 --> 0:22:49,809
No.

146
0:22:50,740 --> 0:22:51,450
But

147
0:22:54,960 --> 0:22:56,660
you win today.

148
0:23:02,940 --> 0:23:03,640
Yeah.

149
0:23:18,660 --> 0:23:19,450
Um,

150
0:23:25,730 --> 0:23:26,450
thank you.

151
0:23:26,539 --> 0:23:27,099
Yeah.

152
0:23:29,559 --> 0:23:30,670
What's wrong?

153
0:23:35,240 --> 0:23:36,160
Uh,

154
0:23:36,839 --> 0:23:37,859
the body.

155
0:23:38,539 --> 0:23:39,259
Thank you.

156
0:23:44,250 --> 0:23:45,119
Get up

157
0:23:45,789 --> 0:23:47,400
the watch, do you?

158
0:23:50,619 --> 0:23:51,739
Bizarre.

159
0:23:51,740 --> 0:23:53,139
What's with him?

160
0:23:53,140 --> 0:23:53,730
What?

161
0:24:17,640 --> 0:24:18,349
What?

162
0:24:23,470 --> 0:24:24,099
But

163
0:24:33,240 --> 0:24:34,019
go

164
0:24:41,660 --> 0:24:42,940
straight back.

165
0:24:44,640 --> 0:24:45,200
Oh,

166
0:24:46,390 --> 0:24:47,220
run.

167
0:24:55,039 --> 0:24:55,599
No.

168
0:24:56,839 --> 0:24:57,609
Fine.

169
0:24:59,440 --> 0:25:00,000
Yeah,

170
0:25:08,539 --> 0:25:09,619
definitely.

171
0:25:12,240 --> 0:25:14,779
I'm I've got to get out of here.

172
0:25:21,339 --> 0:25:22,559
She's through.

173
0:25:22,839 --> 0:25:26,059
This man is a brutal, cold hearted killer.

174
0:25:26,109 --> 0:25:29,369
We must all work toward his apprehension.

175
0:25:29,539 --> 0:25:30,200
What?

176
0:25:31,240 --> 0:25:32,490
Not yet.

177
0:25:34,240 --> 0:25:34,940
No,

178
0:25:41,980 --> 0:25:43,069
yours.

179
0:25:50,809 --> 0:25:51,858
Oh, my Christ.

180
0:25:51,859 --> 0:25:54,348
Pomegranate and effective for Mama.

181
0:25:54,349 --> 0:25:55,640
How rude you are

182
0:25:56,170 --> 0:25:57,160
already,

183
0:25:59,759 --> 0:26:01,098
gentlemen, is everything.

184
0:26:01,099 --> 0:26:02,160
Everyone?

185
0:26:02,410 --> 0:26:03,450
Everything.

186
0:26:03,519 --> 0:26:04,859
They got a base of it.

187
0:26:06,039 --> 0:26:06,650
What?

188
0:26:09,960 --> 0:26:10,589
What?

189
0:26:15,140 --> 0:26:15,839
Yeah.

190
0:26:17,640 --> 0:26:18,230
Okay.

191
0:26:44,539 --> 0:26:46,019
Why go?

192
0:26:47,940 --> 0:26:48,500
No.

193
0:26:51,240 --> 0:26:51,509
Yes.

194
0:26:51,509 --> 0:26:53,759
Lorenzo and his wife.

195
0:26:56,799 --> 0:26:58,368
That's Juliana Angels.

196
0:26:58,369 --> 0:27:00,809
Brother Francesco.

197
0:27:03,640 --> 0:27:04,539
Stress.

198
0:27:05,579 --> 0:27:06,440
Good.

199
0:27:08,839 --> 0:27:09,509
Yeah,

200
0:27:15,589 --> 0:27:16,200
yeah,

201
0:27:16,940 --> 0:27:17,500
yeah.

202
0:27:21,740 --> 0:27:22,329
Hey.

203
0:27:22,640 --> 0:27:23,200
Yeah.

204
0:27:24,339 --> 0:27:25,099
Good.

205
0:27:38,190 --> 0:27:39,799
Oh, God.

206
0:27:40,740 --> 0:27:45,539
Your entire family dies by my song.

207
0:27:46,740 --> 0:27:47,309

Why did you help me?

272
0:33:07,380 --> 0:33:11,079

He understood that on there.

277

Francesco!

347
0:40:54,550 --> 0:41:00,268
Do Patsy brought up as a noble in a city captivated by the newly rich Medici family.

348
0:41:00,269 --> 0:41:05,988
Francesca was taught to hate the middle class and its social climbers dismayed.

349
0:41:05,989 --> 0:41:13,130
He watched as the Medici bank eclipsed his own and centuries of influence over the Florentine government slipped away.

350
0:41:13,610 --> 0:41:16,250
It looks like the Spaniard offered him a solution.

351
0:41:16,280 --> 0:41:18,688
Rather than compete in something as dirty as banking.

352
0:41:18,690 --> 0:41:21,598
Francesco only had to do one thing for the Templars.

353
0:41:21,599 --> 0:41:24,869
One thing to put the middle class in their place for good.

354
0:41:25,510 --> 0:41:28,708
Kill the Medici Giovanni auditory.

355
0:41:28,710 --> 0:41:31,820
Trying to stop Francesco by putting him in gaol.

356
0:41:32,019 --> 0:41:34,320
But the Templars took care of that.

357
0:41:35,880 --> 0:41:39,138
Now feeding say will judge you for what you've done.

358
0:41:39,139 --> 0:41:40,329
It's over.

359
0:41:41,510 --> 0:41:43,630

360
0:41:48,150 --> 0:41:48,538

361
0:41:48,539 --> 0:41:48,888

0:43:29,960 --> 0:43:30,519
Yeah.

373

When I was six years old, I fell into the army.

374
0:43:34,300 --> 0:43:38,550
I soon found myself drifting down into darkness.

375
0:43:39,739 --> 0:43:42,010
Certain my life was that name.

376
0:43:43,900 --> 0:43:47,239

377
0:43:48,210 --> 0:43:54,219
at her sides to the stranger, soaking smiling at me.

378

Did you?

410
0:45:44,690 --> 0:45:45,269
Yeah.

411
0:45:46,139 --> 0:45:46,750
What?

412
0:45:59,489 --> 0:46:00,159
What?

413
0:46:04,179 --> 0:46:04,900
Two.

414
0:46:05,789 --> 0:46:10,218
I've marched the Palazzo Medici on your mat in order to achieve 100%.

415
0:46:10,219 --> 0:46:11,748
Sync with that CEO's life.

416
0:46:11,750 --> 0:46:13,239
You should go explore.

417
0:46:37,380 --> 0:46:38,059
You

418
0:46:39,579 --> 0:46:40,380
stop.

419
0:46:48,980 --> 0:46:49,690
Nice

420
0:46:50,889 --> 0:46:52,530
you two.

421
0:47:18,559 --> 0:47:19,199
Hey.

422
0:48:44,139 --> 0:48:44,719
Yeah,

423
0:49:06,170 --> 0:49:06,929
Go.

424
0:51:56,659 --> 0:51:57,650
Yeah.

425
0:52:00,150 --> 0:52:01,320
Stay back.

426
0:52:01,360 --> 0:52:02,760
Thank you.

427
0:52:13,050 --> 0:52:13,860
Oh,

428
0:52:24,809 --> 0:52:26,889
no need to come forward.

429
0:52:36,949 --> 0:52:37,568
That's better.

430
0:52:37,570 --> 0:52:40,268
For now, prevention is the best cure.

431
0:52:40,269 --> 0:52:41,610
I always say

432
0:52:57,510 --> 0:52:58,078
it's you.

433
0:52:58,079 --> 0:52:59,698
Thank God you're all right.

434
0:52:59,699 --> 0:53:04,118
This madness with the Medici and the patsy is thiss Why you pursued Francesco?

435
0:53:04,119 --> 0:53:05,648
Not exactly.

436
0:53:05,650 --> 0:53:09,408
Well, whatever your reasons, the city safe again, thanks to you.

437
0:53:09,409 --> 0:53:11,869
Now tell me, how may I be of service?

438
0:53:12,420 --> 0:53:14,670
Ah, another page.

439
0:53:16,389 --> 0:53:16,538
My?

440
0:53:16,539 --> 0:53:17,208
Huh?

441
0:53:17,210 --> 0:53:19,388
It's a similar Cypher to the last one.

442
0:53:19,389 --> 0:53:20,869
This won't take long.

443
0:53:21,329 --> 0:53:22,869
Interesting.

444
0:53:23,019 --> 0:53:23,679
Yeah,

445
0:53:24,710 --> 0:53:27,320
DD I see.

446
0:53:27,739 --> 0:53:31,719
It's another blade design for delivering poison.

447
0:53:32,119 --> 0:53:33,489
Can you build it?

448
0:53:33,650 --> 0:53:35,398
See, it won't take very long.

449
0:53:35,400 --> 0:53:39,769
I just need to find a way to hollow out the blade without sacrificing their

450
0:53:40,349 --> 0:53:42,260
It's all right, Leonardo.

451
0:53:42,300 --> 0:53:44,059
Just do what you need to do.

452
0:53:51,099 --> 0:53:52,148
All done.

453
0:53:52,150 --> 0:53:54,828
I feel your blade with a bit of poison to start with.

454
0:53:54,829 --> 0:53:55,898
Should you run out?

455
0:53:55,900 --> 0:54:04,188
Just visit a doctor Boyzone my doctor in high enough doses that which cures can kill.

456
0:54:04,190 --> 0:54:06,178
I am in your debt once more, my friend.

457
0:54:06,179 --> 0:54:07,478
Any time it's you.

458
0:54:07,480 --> 0:54:08,659
Anytime.

459
0:54:09,440 --> 0:54:10,150
Yeah,

460
0:54:12,539 --> 0:54:13,099
Yeah,

461
0:54:18,139 --> 0:54:18,949
Okay,

462
0:54:19,539 --> 0:54:21,050
doesn't it?

463
0:54:28,940 --> 0:54:29,500
No,

464
0:54:33,940 --> 0:54:34,550
it's

465
0:54:51,639 --> 0:54:52,199
Yeah.

466
0:55:24,039 --> 0:55:24,750
Good.

467
0:55:25,389 --> 0:55:26,050
No.

468
0:55:28,639 --> 0:55:29,460
Okay.

469
0:55:31,289 --> 0:55:31,900
No.

470
0:55:32,840 --> 0:55:33,809
Yes.

471
0:55:38,539 --> 0:55:39,190
Okay.

472
0:55:47,840 --> 0:55:48,400
No,

473
0:55:50,599 --> 0:55:52,300
no, No,

474
0:55:57,519 --> 0:55:58,349
thank you.

475
0:56:00,429 --> 0:56:01,500
No, no, no.

476
0:56:11,070 --> 0:56:12,378
And they want to see the master.

477
0:56:12,380 --> 0:56:13,679
Did this.

478
0:56:14,550 --> 0:56:15,239
You

479
0:56:16,539 --> 0:56:17,179
what

480
0:56:36,940 --> 0:56:37,840
question

481
0:56:38,980 --> 0:56:39,789
back?

482
0:58:09,219 --> 0:58:10,300
Yeah.

483
0:58:13,119 --> 0:58:13,900
Yeah.

484
0:58:23,119 --> 0:58:23,988
Date of birth.

485
0:58:23,989 --> 0:58:24,558
14.

486
0:58:24,559 --> 0:58:25,528
49.

487
0:58:25,530 --> 0:58:26,358
Profession.

488
0:58:26,360 --> 0:58:34,358
Ruler of Florence simultaneously keeping the dream of the Florentine Republic alive while leaving the people with very little legitimate power.

489
0:58:34,360 --> 0:58:36,998
Lorenzo de Medici definitely ruled Renaissance Florence.

490
0:58:37,000 --> 0:58:48,530
During its golden age, Lorenzo's grandfather, Cosimo, built the Medici bank, creating one of the most powerful financial institutions in Europe and becoming fabulously rich in the process.

491
0:58:48,690 --> 0:58:51,398
Considered the smartest of Kasim owes grandchildren.

492
0:58:51,400 --> 0:58:55,158
Lorenzo was already being sent on diplomatic missions as a child.

493
0:58:55,159 --> 0:58:58,808
Although his father was inept in sickly, his mother was a poet.

494
0:58:58,809 --> 0:59:04,619
She introduced Lorenzo to many of the prominent artists of the day and stealing in him a love of art and culture.

495
0:59:04,730 --> 0:59:18,418
In 14 69 when he was only 20 Lorenzo became the head of the Medici family, at which point he quickly gained control of the Florentine government through friends in the city, Council payoffs, strategic marriages and threats.

496
0:59:18,420 --> 0:59:21,418
But Florence prospered with Lorenzo as its puppeteer.

497
0:59:21,420 --> 0:59:29,739
A piece was made between the warring states of Italy and several masterpieces of Renaissance art by the likes of BOTTICELLI and Michelangelo were made under his care.

498
0:59:29,789 --> 0:59:35,428
Ultimately, Lorenzo was happier writing poetry and shadow governing than directing his family's bank.

499
0:59:35,429 --> 0:59:43,070
During his lifetime, several branches of the bank collapsed and the Medici assets were wasted on frivolities such as jousting tournaments.

500
0:59:43,190 --> 0:59:45,688
Lorenzo died in 14 92.

501
0:59:45,690 --> 0:59:51,558
Nearly broke, he was unable to prevent the popular backlash against his rich lifestyle and the mad monk Savonarola.

502
0:59:51,559 --> 0:59:53,110
His rise to power.

503
0:59:56,519 --> 0:59:57,408
Date of birth.

504
0:59:57,409 --> 1:00:02,908
14 50 for profession, scholar, poet, somewhat of a prodigy.

505
1:00:02,909 --> 1:00:08,448
Poland's Yano learned Latin and Greek at age 10 and by 18 had already become a published author.

506
1:00:08,449 --> 1:00:15,090
Lorenzo de Medici hired him to act as the tutor for his Children and made sure he received a post at the studio Fiorentino.

507
1:00:15,210 --> 1:00:19,398
Unfortunately, pullets Yano must not have been everyone's favourite instructor.

508
1:00:19,400 --> 1:00:26,010
He died of arsenic poisoning in 14 94 probably murdered by Pierre of the Medici, his former student

509
1:00:28,610 --> 1:00:29,458
Date of birth.

510
1:00:29,460 --> 1:00:31,058
14 53.

511
1:00:31,059 --> 1:00:31,868
Profession.

512
1:00:31,869 --> 1:00:42,710
Noble, the playboy to his brother Lorenzo, statesman Giuliano de Medici was well known for his famous jousting tournaments, his handsome physique and his illegitimate child.

513
1:00:42,809 --> 1:00:45,688
When Giuliano was killed in the pot, see conspiracy.

514
1:00:45,690 --> 1:00:56,858
His son Giulio was considered legitimate due to a loophole in canon law that allowed marriages to occur privately between two people meeting that his parents could have agreed that they were actually married without telling anyone about it.

515
1:00:56,860 --> 1:00:58,158
Watch out, Catholics.

516
1:00:58,159 --> 1:01:00,808
Your mistresses have more power than you think.

517
1:01:00,809 --> 1:01:06,730
Once legitimately a Medici, this child of a tradesman is daughter went on to become Pope Clement the seventh.

518
1:01:06,920 --> 1:01:08,158
Get this Clement.

519
1:01:08,159 --> 1:01:14,759
The seventh was Pope during the sack of Rome in 15 27 during which he was taken prisoner in the Costel Santangelo.

520
1:01:14,760 --> 1:01:18,170
He escaped his captors disguised as a tradesman.

521
1:01:18,420 --> 1:01:24,018
Son of a tradesman is daughter escapes poor pass to become pope on ly to become a tradesman once more.

522
1:01:24,019 --> 1:01:25,420
Oh, the irony,

523
1:01:32,010 --> 1:01:38,518
proclamations, local laws, news market days and advertisements were all called out by heralds.

524
1:01:38,519 --> 1:01:49,429
Since many Renaissance Italians could not read, special laws had to be put in place to protect them from the crowd due to extreme displays of unhappiness following the announcement of tax increases.

525
1:01:59,409 --> 1:01:59,969
Yeah.

526
1:02:04,909 --> 1:02:05,469
Hey,

527
1:02:06,409 --> 1:02:07,130
what?

527
1:02:14,909 --> 1:02:15,000
Okay,
