1
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,050
You were gone for quite a while.

2
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,937
Leonardo likes to talk.

3
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:18,949
PAOLA: That he does, but I trust he did more than talk.

4
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,949
PAOLA: Impressive.

5
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,379
I'm rather fond of it myself.

6
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,588
I've given you the skills, Leonardo's given you the blade.

7
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,439
All that remains is the deed.

8
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,489
Where can I find Uberto?

9
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,599
According to my girls, he'll be attending
an unveiling tonight of Verrocchio's latest work.

10
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,059
It will be held at the Santa Croce cloister.

11
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,699
Watch over my mother and sister while I'm away.

12
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,220
Of course, Ezio, as if they were my own.

13
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,489
UBERTO: Again with this?

14
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,598
LORENZO: You have overstepped your bounds Uberto.

15
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,919
UBERTO: Who are you to speak of bounds?

16
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,899
UBERTO: You who have crowned yourself Lorenzo de Medici,
Principe of Firenze (Prince of Florence).

17
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,338
I've done no such thing.

18
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,649
Of course not, ever innocent. How convenient.

19
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,329
At least now we see how far your reach extends, which is to say nowhere at all.

20
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,759
It has proved a valuable lesson for me and my allies.

21
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,259
Yes, your allies the Pazzi. Is that what this is about?

22
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,470
Be careful with your words, Lorenzo.

23
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,370
You might attract the wrong sort of attention.

24
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,218
GUEST 1: Good evening, Gonfalionere.

25
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:08,629
UBERTO: To you as well. I trust you're enjoying yourselves?

26
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:13,049
GUEST 1: Indeed, a nice distraction from
that nasty business with the Auditore family.

27
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,367
UBERTO: And to think I once thought of Giovanni as a brother.

28
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,189
GUEST 1: Don't blame yourself.

29
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,007
GUEST 1: How could you have known what evils he planned?

30
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,899
GUEST 2: I say we strike that traitor's name from the record books.

31
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,299
GUEST 2: Let history forget he ever even existed.

32
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:32,750
UBERTO: Hmm, yes. If you'll excuse me for a moment.

33
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,639
BEATRICE: Uberto, a moment of your time?

34
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,089
UBERTO: Anything for you, Beatrice.

35
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:55,559
BEATRICE: So tell us, how does it feel to be a hero?

36
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,347
UBERTO: Please, I am no such thing.

37
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:06,500
UBERTO: As Gonfaloniere it is my duty to ensure that
the city of Firenze remains a shining beacon of justice.

38
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:13,038
UBERTO: Corruption and its ilk shall find
no purchase here so long as I am in control.

39
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,119
BEATRICE: You are a treasure, Uberto. I hope Lorenzo recognises that.

40
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,446
UBERTO: Yes, our great leader Lorenzo. [coughs]

41
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,850
UBERTO: I will see you ladies later.

42
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,459
GUEST 3: Ah, Uberto, there you are.

43
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,490
GUEST 3: I was just telling the others about the execution.

44
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,478
GUEST 4: I mean no offence, but what if they did not act alone?

45
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:51,110
UBERTO: You can rest easy, friends.

46
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:57,529
UBERTO: I am confident that this treachery
began and ended with the Auditore family.

47
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,226
GUEST 5: What of the other son, Ezio was it?

48
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,009
UBERTO: The child poses no danger. Soft hands and an even softer head.

49
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:10,700
UBERTO: He'll be caught and executed before the week is out.

50
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,320
GUEST 3: Don't let us keep you, Uberto. We just wanted to say hello.

51
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,186
GUEST 4: Evening to you, Gonfaloniere.

52
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,850
UBERTO: Is everything to your satisfaction?

53
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,749
GUEST 4: Do you even need to ask? Of course!

54
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,320
GUEST 5: Accept our thanks, for this evening,
and for helping to keep Firenze safe.

55
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,070
GUEST 5: I always had my doubts about the Auditore.

56
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,399
GUEST 5: Where did the family even come from?

57
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,833
GUEST 5: To gain such wealth and–and prestige in just a single generation.

58
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:52,360
GUEST 4: And the children, with their odd names, always making trouble.

59
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,159
GUEST 5: No surprise given the company that father kept.

60
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,389
GUEST 5: Whores and thieves I swear it.

61
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,345
UBERTO: Indeed, it is clear now he sought to undermine the city.

62
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:06,620
UBERTO: To overturn all we've worked so hard to build.

63
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,129
GUEST 5: But thanks to you, that's over now.

64
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,110
UBERTO: You!

65
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,159
SHAUN: Uberto Alberti.

66
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,538
SHAUN: Trusted friend of the Auditore family.

67
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,980
SHAUN: According to the history books this guy was a saint.

68
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,839
SHAUN: He prosecuted murderers, rapists, the worst criminals.

69
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,000
SHAUN: One of the best lawyers in Italy, he won every case.

70
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,639
SHAUN: In spite of the fact that he was self-taught.

71
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,479
SHAUN: Now, I've found a back door into the Templars' database server.

72
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,350
SHAUN: I've been combing it for some kind of smoking gun.

73
00:12:58,539 --> 00:12:59,850
SHAUN: I found it.

74
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,158
SHAUN: Apparently Uberto's family was evicted by the Medici Bank.

75
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,450
SHAUN: Uberto's been aching for revenge ever since.

76
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,149
SHAUN: And the Templars promised him support.

77
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,369
SHAUN: Ezio's father was standing in the way.

78
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,750
SHAUN: And Uberto was jealous of his influence over the Florentine government.

79
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,690
SHAUN: Two birds with one stone, isn't it?

80
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,750
SHAUN: It looks like Uberto used his election
to the Signoria as his opportunity to strike.

81
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,038
UBERTO: You would have done the same to save the ones you love.

82
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,519
Yes, I would. And I have!

83
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,358
The Auditore are not dead!

84
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:48,475
I'm still here! Me! Ezio! Ezio Auditore!

85
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,754
I think it's best I leave Firenze.

86
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,079
PAOLA: Where will you go?

87
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,787
My uncle Mario owns a villa near Monteriggioni.

88
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,789
You're still a wanted man, Ezio.

89
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,692
What would you have me do, then?

90
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:29,279
I've seen posters all across the district.

91
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,809
Tearing them down will help the city forget your face.

92
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,513
No doubt the heralds also incite the public.

93
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:38,399
Bribe them and they'll speak of other things.

94
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,028
Or you could hunt those who bear false witness against you.

95
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,537
They traded dignity for coin. Their loss would not be mourned.

96
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,259
Do any of these things and you should be free to leave.

97
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,088
REBECCA: I've added a program for tracking notoriety.

98
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:07,880
REBECCA: This little meter will help you know
how far you are between notorious and incognito.

99
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,950
REBECCA: This will help you know if you should watch your actions.

100
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,319
REBECCA: It'll also tell you if your notoriety level is part of Ezio's memory or not.

101
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,970
Bentornato (Welcome back) Ezio. Were you successful?

102
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,190
Yes.

103
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,160
Madre (Mother)?

104
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,440
CLAUDIA: Ezio! Where have you been? They wouldn't let us leave.

105
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,568
CLAUDIA: And mother, oh!
She hasn't spoken a single word since we left the house.

106
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,649
CLAUDIA: Father will need to sort things out.

107
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,190
CLAUDIA: Where is Father, and Federico, and Petruccio? Hmm?

108
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,669
Something's happened.

109
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:06,960
What do you mean?

110
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:11,399
No, it's impossible!

111
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,288
Claudia.

112
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,118
CLAUDIA: No! No, no, no, no!

113
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,859
I did everything I could, piccina (little one).

114
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,980
Listen! Right now, what matters is getting us all someplace safe.

115
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,480
But to do that, I need you to stay focused.

116
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,039
Do you understand?

117
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:39,490
Good, will you watch over mother for me?

118
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,670
Then we are ready. Thank you again for everything.

119
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,149
Stay safe, Ezio, stay vigilant.

120
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,779
I suspect the road ahead is yet long.

121
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,160
EZIO: On me.

122
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,999
CLAUDIA: How could this have happened to us?

123
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,349
EZIO: I don't know.

124
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,939
CLAUDIA: Will we ever be back?

125
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,490
EZIO: I don't know.

126
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,828
CLAUDIA: What will happen to our house?

127
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,429
EZIO: I don't know!

128
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,859
CLAUDIA: Were they… Were they given a proper burial?

129
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,160
EZIO: Yes, they were.

130
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,903
EZIO: We should be close.

131
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:42,842
CLAUDIA: Grazie Dio (Thank God)!

132
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,349
Buongiorno, Ezio.

133
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,868
How could you leave Firenze without saying a proper goodbye?

134
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:58,779
CLAUDIA: Ezio!

135
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,190
What do you want, Vieri?

136
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,890
VIERI: So many things.

137
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:11,160
A larger palazzo, two new steeds, a prettier bride…

138
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,950
Oh, and yes, your life.

139
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,950
VIERI: My condolences for the—

140
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,869
VIERI: —loss of your father and brothers.

141
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,660
VIERI: What will happen now that there's no one left to help you?

142
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:31,279
VIERI: I have such wonderful things in store for your mother and sister.

143
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,789
I grow tired of this game.

144
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:43,829
Finish him, and do not spare the women!

145
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,300
What's sorcery is this?

146
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,347
VOICE: Ha ha ha ha ha! Not sorcery, boy, skill.

147
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:52,746
Show yourself!

148
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:54,339
VOICE: As you wish.

149
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,588
VOICE: Here, use this!

150
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:59,619
Kill them! Kill them all!

151
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,749
You have my thanks.

152
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,450
Keep the sword, Ezio.

153
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,660
Do I know you from somewhere?

154
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,049
Don't you recognise me? It's-a-me, Mario!

155
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,720
Uncle Mario?!

156
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,160
It's been too long, nipote (nephew), far too long.

157
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:24,349
I heard what happened in Firenze, terrible.

158
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,549
Come, let's get you all away from here.

159
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,950
MARIO: So, tell me everything.

160
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,549
EZIO: They executed father for treason.

161
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,069
EZIO: Federico and Petruccio too.

162
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,259
EZIO: Then they came for me.

163
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:08,849
MARIO: Do you know why?

164
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,779
EZIO: I have no answers uncle,
only a list of names taken from a man who wished me dead.

165
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,699
EZIO: I still can't believe they are gone.

166
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,669
MARIO: Don't worry, we will make sense of this.

167
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,739
EZIO: I wish I shared your optimism.

168
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,563
MARIO: I think you will find much to like in Monteriggioni.

169
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:27,810
EZIO: I thought Monteriggioni was an enemy of Firenze?

170
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,999
MARIO: For now. Next year it will be its friend.

171
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,269
MARIO: The year after, its enemy again, and on, and on.

172
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,259
MARIO: I cannot keep track, so I've stopped trying.

173
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:40,170
MARIO: These are honest, hardworking people.

174
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,139
MARIO: Our shops may only carry simple goods,
but they're well made and dependable.

175
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,989
MARIO: There's a chapel here too.

176
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,339
MARIO: The prete (priest) seems a nice enough fellow,
but I've never been much of a believer.

177
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:57,038
MARIO: Did you know the Villa Auditore is almost 200 years old?

178
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,500
MARIO: It was built by my great-grandfather,
a strange man who carried all kinds of secrets.

179
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:06,349
MARIO: Keep your eyes open and you might discover a few of them yourself.

180
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,789
MARIO: With all the fighting that's been going on,
this place has started to get a bit rough around the edges.

181
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,960
MARIO: I wish I could do something about it,
but I just don't have the time or money to fix things up.

182
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,590
MARIO: Guess that's life, huh?

183
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,349
MARIO: Here we are, casa dolce casa (home sweet home).

184
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,789
MARIO: So what do you think?

185
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,398
EZIO: It's most impressive, uncle.

186
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,110
MARIO: She's seen better days, I suppose.

187
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,960
MARIO: Believe me, I'd have her shining again if only I had the time.

188
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,528
MARIO: Now that you have had the tour nipote, you should go and outfit yourself.

189
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,067
MARIO: My men in the market are expecting you.

190
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:46,059
MARIO: Return here when you're finished and we'll begin.

191
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:48,759
EZIO: "Begin"? Begin what?

192
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,050
MARIO: I thought you'd come here to train.

193
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:57,940
EZIO: No, uncle, I came here to escape Firenze,
and I intend to take my family further still.

194
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,738
MARIO: But what about your father? He'd want you to finish his work.

195
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:04,738
EZIO: What work? My father was a banker.

196
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,118
MARIO: Wait, he did not tell you?

197
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,538
EZIO: I have no idea what you're talking about.

198
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:12,110
MARIO: Ma che mi combini (What were you thinking), Giovanni?!

199
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,849
MARIO: Where to even begin?

200
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,086
MARIO: Go and fetch the gear in the market, it will give me time to think.

201
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:22,300
EZIO: But– 
MARIO: But that's that. We'll talk more later.

202
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,688
MARIO: Some spending money should you need it.

203
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,550
MARIO: And if you find yourself in need of rest,
I've prepared a room for you on the top floor of the villa.

204
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:31,586
SUBJECT 16: The past, a vast web of connections
and interconnections all ruled by chance. Or is it?

205
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,378
EZIO: Don't worry, we're only staying here for a little while.

206
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,218
CLAUDIA: I don't like it here, I want to go home.

207
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,320
EZIO: I know.

208
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,836
EZIO: Salute, uncle, I did as you asked.

209
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:46,567
MARIO: And quickly too, ben fatto (well done)! 

210
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,309
MARIO: Now let's teach you how to fight.

211
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:53,230
EZIO: No, as I said we are leaving.

212
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,900
Ezio! You barely held your own against Vieri.

213
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,204
You won't survive a week on the road.

214
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,938
If you want to leave, so be it.

215
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,110
But at least do so armed with
the skills and knowledge necessary to defend yourself.

216
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,298
If not for me, for your mother and sister.

217
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,329
EZIO: Fine.

218
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,610
Ottimo (Very good)! 

219
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,158
MARIO: You can swing a sword to be sure.

220
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,150
MARIO: But offence alone will not carry a battle.

221
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,809
MARIO: You must survive long enough to strike!

222
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:30,139
MARIO: I will teach you how to dodge.

223
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,010
EZIO: You said my father was more than just a banker.

224
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:38,376
MARIO: Ah, no use dancing around it I suppose.

225
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:41,219
MARIO: Your father was an Assassin, Ezio.

226
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,639
EZIO: I told you before, my father was a paper pusher.

227
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:49,309
MARIO: No, he was born and bred to kill.

228
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,420
EZIO: I find this difficult to believe.

229
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,340
MARIO: What of the list you carry?

230
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,498
MARIO: Do you think it's merely a catalogue of debts?

231
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,909
MARIO: It holds the names of those responsible for your father's murder.

232
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:30,448
MARIO: Bene, I've taught you how to avoid your enemy's attacks.

233
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:33,909
MARIO: Now you'll learn how to turn them to your advantage.

234
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,800
EZIO: All this talk of Assassins and Templars.

235
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,860
EZIO: It reeks of fantasy.

236
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:44,647
MARIO: Like something from an old parchment
covered in arcane writing, perhaps?

237
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,909
EZIO: How did you know?

238
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,599
MARIO: You have your father's blade.

239
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,170
MARIO: I figured you'd have the Codex page he was holding as well.

240
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:54,809
EZIO: "Codex"?

241
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:58,968
MARIO: Si, a guide to the inner workings of the order.

242
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:02,849
MARIO: Its origin, purpose, and techniques. Our creed, if you will.

243
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:06,888
MARIO: Your father believed the Codex contained a powerful secret.

244
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:09,188
MARIO: Something that would change the world.

245
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,800
MARIO: Perhaps it's why they came for him.

246
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:17,500
EZIO: Assassins, Templars, Codex pages, this is a lot to take in.

247
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,477
MARIO: You need to open your mind, Ezio.

248
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:24,000
MARIO: Always remember: nothing is true, everything is permitted.

249
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,509
MARIO: You're making fine progress, Ezio.

250
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:39,989
MARIO: Today, I'm going to teach you how to position yourself in battle.

251
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:44,619
MARIO: Where you stand and how you move can make all the difference.

252
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,610
MARIO: Don't think I haven't seen you picking apart my library.

253
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,090
MARIO: I trust you believe me now?

254
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,480
EZIO: Yes, my father was an Assassin.

255
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,838
EZIO: But why the need for such secrecy?

256
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,400
MARIO: Are you familiar with the Templars?

257
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,500
MARIO: One of several knightly orders formed during the Crusades.

258
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:10,628
MARIO: History teaches they were disbanded
nearly two hundred years ago in France.

259
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,442
MARIO: Only they weren't.

260
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:17,090
MARIO: Merely pushed underground where they continue their nefarious work.

261
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,789
EZIO: What work?

262
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:22,638
MARIO: The Templars seek dominion over man.

263
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,789
MARIO: And we, the Assassins, are sworn to stand against them.

264
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,318
EZIO: Was Uberto one of them?

265
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,468
MARIO: Yes.

266
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:32,900
EZIO: And the other names on my father's list?

267
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,090
MARIO: Templars as well.

268
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,857
EZIO: That means Vieri…

269
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,714
MARIO: Just like his father, Francesco.

270
00:47:40,714 --> 00:47:42,989
MARIO: Likely the entire Pazzi family.

271
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,199
EZIO: Ehi, it would explain many things.

272
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,588
Well done, nipote (nephew). You've really come into your own.

273
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,758
Thank you, Uncle, for all you have given me.

274
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:35,298
You're family, such is my duty and my desire.

275
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,481
I'm glad you had me stay.

276
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:39,639
Good, you've reconsidered leaving?

277
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,970
We sail for Spain in three days.

278
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:49,718
MARIO: But nipote, I have given you the skills that
you might be better prepared to strike against our enemies.

279
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,420
And if they find me, I will.

280
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,145
MARIO: You want to leave Ezio?

281
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:57,000
To throw away everything your father fought and died for?

282
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,787
To deny your heritage? Fine!

283
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:02,918
Come vuoi (So be it). Arrivederci e buona fortuna (Goodbye and good luck).

284
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,009
Uncle, wait! Why is he so upset?

285
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,380
How can he not be?

286
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,311
Vieri has been harassing us ever since you first arrived.

287
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:12,300
To be expected, I suppose given his heritage.

288
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,000
Uncle!

289
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:34,460
EZIO: Where is everyone?

290
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,269
MERCENARY: They ride for San Gimignano to slay that snake Vieri.

291
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,880
EZIO: I wish to join them.

292
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,519
MERCENARY: You'll find what you need at the stables.

293
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,296
CLAUDIA: Ezio, look at her. I still can't get her to talk.

294
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,908
CLAUDIA: She spends all day and night
in front of those feathers Petruccio used to collect.

295
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:55,458
CLAUDIA: She can't let him go, I don't know what to do.

296
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,269
EZIO: Don't worry, she'll come back to us, I know it.
