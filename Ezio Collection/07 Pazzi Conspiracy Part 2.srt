1
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,699
Ah, there you are. Listen, we've found Stefano da Bagnone.

2
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,000
Just follow this road, and it'll bring you
to the abbey where he's taken refuge.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,533
Wait, before you go take these.

4
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,266
You can use them to create a distraction.

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,766
EZIO: My thanks, friend.

6
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,966
MONK: Let us pray, brother.

7
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:36,933
STEFANO: Pray? Pray for what?

8
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,233
MONK: The Lord's protection.

9
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:44,766
STEFANO: If you think the Lord has any interest in our affairs,
you've another think coming.

10
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:51,166
STEFANO: But please, by all means,
continue to delude yourself if it helps to pass the time.

11
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,399
MONK: You speak blasphemy!

12
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,133
STEFANO: No, I speak truth.

13
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,800
MONK: But to deny His most exalted existence—

14
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,166
STEFANO: …is the only rational response when faced with the
declaration that there exists some invisible madman in the sky.

15
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:13,199
STEFANO: And believe me, if your precious Bible is anything
to go by, he's completely lost his mind.

16
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,766
MONK: How can you speak of such, you wear His vestments!

17
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:21,899
STEFANO: Only because they afforded me
the opportunity to get close to the Medici.

18
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,566
STEFANO: But you're right, I should look into replacing them
after the assassin is dealt with.

19
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,433
MONK: Oh! That unholy demon!

20
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,533
STEFANO: At least on this, we agree.

21
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:37,366
MONK: They say the devil has gifted him
with unnatural speed and strength.

22
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:42,899
STEFANO: The devil? No.
These are gifts he gave himself through training.

23
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,533
STEFANO: It is disturbing how unwilling
you are to credit people for their circumstances.

24
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:53,033
STEFANO: I think you'd make victims
out of the entire world if you could.

25
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,166
MONK: I forgive your lack of faith and forked tongue.

26
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,766
MONK: You are still one of His children.

27
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:02,399
STEFANO:  I told you… oh, what's the use?

28
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,233
STEFANO: Enough of this, it is like speaking to the wind.

29
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,666
MONK: I will pray for you.

30
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:12,100
STEFANO: As you wish, but do so quietly, I must keep watch.

31
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,733
STEFANO: Now I will see who was right.

32
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,100
EZIO: Where is Jacopo?

33
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,399
STEFANO: Nothing to fear, I suppose.

34
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,533
STEFANO: They meet in the shadow of the Roman gods.

35
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,466
EZIO: Ora sei libero dalla paura (Be free of your fear now).

36
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,533
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

37
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,633
MERCENARY: Over here, Ezio.

38
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,700
MERCENARY: Over here, Ezio.

39
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
We've found Archbishop Salviati.

40
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,833
He's barricaded himself inside that villa.

41
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,933
Take some of my men, use them to clear the fields.

42
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,233
Then find a way over the wall so you can open the gates.

43
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,600
EZIO: Ah, command over my own army.

44
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,566
EZIO: A nice change of pace
from the usual sneaking and stabbing.

45
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,933
EZIO: I like it.

46
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,433
SALVIATI: I see you there Assassin!

47
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
SALVIATI: These walls have stood for a hundred years,
and will stand for a hundred more.

48
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,399
SALVIATI: Stop wasting the lives of your men!

49
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,533
SALVIATI: Vattene (Get out)! Vattene via (Go away)!

50
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,833
SALVIATI: All that awaits you here is death, turn back!

51
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,366
SALVIATI: Men, prepare yourselves. The Assassin has arrived!

52
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,833
EZIO: I need to find a way to open the gates.

53
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,833
SALVIATI: I warned you to stay away, Assassin!
You should have listened.

54
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,833
SALVIATI: You're finished, Assassin. You hear me?

55
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:49,099
EZIO: You Templars, always singing the same song.

56
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,599
SALVIATI: You think a few mercenari will scare me? Ha!

57
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,133
EZIO: They should.

58
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,933
SALVIATI: Shall I send your remains
to that ubriacone (drunkard), Mario?

59
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:04,733
SALVIATI: Ha ha, what's the point?
There won't be anything left of you to recognise.

60
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:10,166
EZIO: It's quite a plan you have,
spouting nonsense while you send these other men to die.

61
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,833
SALVIATI: I am a reasonable man, what say you to this?

62
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,599
SALVIATI: Turn back now and I'll call off my men.

63
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,500
EZIO: Sorry, friend. You are on my list. Your fate is sealed.

64
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,566
SALVIATI: Tear him limb from limb, let us paint the—

65
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,633
EZIO: That is no way to treat a guest.

66
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,633
EZIO: Where is Jacopo?

67
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,500
SALVIATI: He knows you come for him.

68
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,266
SALVIATI: Emerging only in darkness to meet with the others.

69
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,066
EZIO: That answers when.

70
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:47,000
EZIO: La fede dovrebbe dare conforto, non pena.
(Faith should bring comfort, not pain.)

71
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,799
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

72
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:08,400
If I can stay my blade long enough to follow him,
he'll lead me to his Templar brothers.

73
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,633
EZIO: I'll have more names for my list.

74
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,033
EZIO: What's going on here? Are they late?
They haven't seen me, this much I know.

75
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:18,233
EZIO: What are you and the others planning, Jacopo?

76
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,633
EZIO: Your letter mentioned Venezia.
Are there Templars there as well?

77
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,766
EZIO: How many men are responsible for my father's death?

78
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:44,266
JACOPO: I'm sorry maestro.
I did all I could but the Assassin proved too strong.

79
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:48,299
Clearly, else the others would be here with you.

80
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,000
To say nothing of the fact that Firenze remains in Medici hands.

81
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:59,299
It's Francesco's fault, his impatience made him reckless.

82
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,966
I–I tried to be the voice of reason.

83
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,966
More like the voice of cowardice.

84
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,866
You're one to talk, Signor Barbarigo.

85
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:11,866
Had you sent us quality weapons instead of
this garbage you Venetians call armament—

86
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:12,799
ENOUGH!

87
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:19,966
We put our faith in your family,
and you repay us with inaction and incompetence?!

88
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,033
Then when asked to account for your failures,
you make excuses and insult us?! 

89
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,066
How do you expect me to respond?

90
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,566
I don't know.

91
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,900
It's alright, I do.

92
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,299
JACOPO: Aaah, no!

93
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:43,000
Please, d–d–don't!

94
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,033
Ha ha ha! Please don't what?

95
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,966
I can … fix this.

96
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,466
Spare me!

97
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,766
No!

98
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,166
What a mess.

99
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:15,000
So sorry to have claimed your prize, Assassin!

100
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,533
Did you honestly think I wouldn't expect you to follow?

101
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,299
That I didn't plan for it?

102
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,666
We've been at this a lot longer than you.

103
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,299
Kill him.

104
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:38,266
I know you're only doing as you're told,
so if you release me I will spare your lives.

105
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,333
Ha! Listen to this—

106
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,833
EZIO: Vai, amico, libero da fardelli e paure
(Go on, friend, unburdened and unafraid).

107
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,833
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

108
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:51,033
The Pazzi are dead, every one of them.

109
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:57,666
I must admit, I've never before believed
I could desire the death of others so badly.

110
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,266
Nor I.

111
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:00,266
Ezio.

112
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:06,199
Thank you for the role you've played
in keeping this dream of mine alive a little longer.

113
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,900
L'onore è mio (The honour is mine), Signore.

114
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,400
What will you do now, figliolo (my boy)?

115
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,833
There are still others I must hunt, Signore.

116
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:17,233
They're already digging their claws into the heart of Venezia.

117
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:20,500
No! La Bella Venezia (beautiful Venice)…

118
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,533
Then that is where your journey must take you, Ezio.

119
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:28,866
Before you leave us, I have something for you. A gift.

120
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:33,599
This cape identifies you as a friend of the Medici.

121
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:39,633
As long as you wear it,
the city guards will be more tolerant of your actions.

122
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:44,066
But be warned, it will not grant you immunity from the law.

123
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,466
Che la fortuna favorisca la tua lama
(May fortune favour your blade).

124
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,333
Leonardo. Leonardo!

125
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:49,066
Mi dispiace, Messere (I am sorry, sir), but he is gone.

126
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,533
Maestro Leonardo was commissioned
by a Venetian noble to paint some portraits.

127
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:57,666
He paid for the maestro
to move his entire workshop to Venezia.

128
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:58,933
It's quite an opportunity.

129
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,800
Grazie mile (Thanks a lot), friend.

130
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:26,766
EZIO: Buon giorno.

131
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:31,033
ARCHITECT: Salute, Ser Ezio. Shall we take a look at the list?


132
00:44:58,033 --> 00:44:59,333
ARCHITECT: Buon viaggio!

133
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:39,133
Leonardo!

134
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:45,300
Ezio? What luck! I er … have run into a bit of trouble.

135
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,333
EZIO: Let me see if I can help.

136
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,099
LEONARDO: I know how to fix it, but lack the means to do so.

137
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,033
LEONARDO: If you could just lift the wagon…

138
00:48:58,466 --> 00:48:59,500
What is this thing?

139
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,333
LEONARDO: Eh?

140
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,066
It looks like a giant bat.

141
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh nothing, just an idea I've been working on.

142
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,633
I could not leave it behind.

143
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:08,800
What is it for?

144
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,566
Well, I shouldn't really talk about it.

145
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,866
Ehi, al diavolo (the hell with it), I can't hold it in anymore!

146
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,533
Ezio, I think I figured out how to make a man fly!

147
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:25,599
[laughs] Come on, I'll drive.

148
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,199
LEONARDO: But I haven't even told you where I'm going?

149
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:47,900
Venezia, such a beautiful city, so many sources of inspiration.

150
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,599
Ponte de Rialto, Piazzo San Marco, L'Arsenale–

151
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:51,900
EZIO: Ssh!
LEONARDO: What's wrong?

152
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,300
We're not alone.

153
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
What's happening? Who are they?

154
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,400
Rodrigo Borgia's men.

155
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,333
Why, what do they want with us?

156
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,533
I think they want us dead.

157
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:05,500
Leonardo, hide!

158
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:22,833
EZIO: Hold on tight, it's going to be a little rough!

159
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:50,900
LEONARDO: Hold on, Ezio! We're almost there!

160
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:12,099
Go, Leonardo! They're here for me, not you.

161
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:13,699
I'll catch up with you later.
