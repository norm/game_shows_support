1
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,066
EZIO: You seem to be healing well.

2
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,599
How are you finding Venezia?

3
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,199
It has it's charms.

4
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,300
But how do you deal with the smell? Che schifo (How disgusting)!

5
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,666
So what brings you to me?

6
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,099
I was hoping you could help me with something.

7
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,066
ROSA: And that would be…?

8
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,099
EZIO: I want to learn to climb the way you do.

9
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,199
Oh. Va bene, I can do that.

10
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,633
Well, I can't, but Franco can.

11
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,066
ROSA: Franco! Muovi il culo (move your ass)!

12
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,866
ROSA: Show Ezio how to reach the top of that scaffolding.

13
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,833
Begin in a hanging position.

14
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,666
ROSA: Then jump to the ledge above you.

15
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,399
ROSA: As you reach it, grab it with your hand and pull yourself up.

16
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,533
There, see how it works?

17
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,733
I think so.

18
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,100
Only one way to find out, try for yourself.

19
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,800
ROSA: Jump, Ezio!

20
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,466
ROSA: Grab the ledge at the height of your jump.

21
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,899
So? How did I do?

22
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,766
I've seen better.

23
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,366
Ah, you wound me with your cruel, cruel words.

24
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:15,366
Alright smargiasso (show off), let's put your skills to the test.

25
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,066
EZIO: I'm all ears.

26
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,533
ROSA: Meet me in front of the Frari!

27
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,666
Ah, Ezio, I was hoping you might return.

28
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,466
I want your advice on something.

29
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,100
EZIO: Of course. Tell me what troubles you.

30
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:25,033
Emilio has turned some of my own men against me.

31
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,066
Bribery and blackmail, is it? 

32
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:30,766
Yes. And we cannot strike until the traitors are dealt with.

33
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,633
They're still somewhere in this district.

34
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,800
Keeping tabs on us and reporting back to Emilio.

35
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,100
Not for much longer, they're not.

36
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:45,933
SUBJECT 16: Without the staff, the Czar was powerless.

37
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:49,266
SUBJECT 16: He could no longer control his subjects.

38
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,500
SUBJECT 16: Revolution! Revolution!

39
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,333
SUBJECT 16: Three thefts, hidden by the murders.

40
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:58,200
SUBJECT 16: People only see what they're trained to see…

41
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,099
SUBJECT 16: What the organisation wants them to see.

42
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,500
SUBJECT 16: The wolves are out hunting.

43
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,833
SUBJECT 16: Where oh where has Jack gone?

44
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,966
ROSA: Climbing a bit of scaffolding is all well and good,
but let's see how you do out in the open.

45
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,933
EZIO: The top of that tower then?

46
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,599
EZIO: Torno fra un attimo (I'll be right back).

47
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,599
EZIO: So?

48
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,299
Looks like you've learned all I have to teach you.

49
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,400
I'll let Antonio know of your progress.

50
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,733
Finish your other tasks, we're almost there.

51
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,233
EZIO: Ben trovato (Good to see you), Ugo. What's the trouble?

52
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:58,533
You and Rosa managed to escape from Seta, but the others were not so lucky.

53
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,933
Emilio's captured them, and now they await execution.

54
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,766
EZIO: Do you know where they're being held?

55
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,166
I know they're still in the district, but beyond that, no.

56
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,366
You'll have to look for them.

57
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,933
EZIO: I'll have your brothers back here in no time.

58
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:18,933
THIEF: The markets belong to the people! Emilio says he seeks unity—

59
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,266
GUARD: Where's your—

60
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,133
THIEVES: Aaah! Ow!

61
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:00,500
GUARD 1: Ha ha ha ha, listen to them squeal!

62
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,533
GUARD 2: It's no wonder their master hides.

63
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,400
GUARD 3: Where is Emilio? I'd like to be rid of this trash.

64
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:13,500
I'm impressed, I didn't expect you to succeed so quickly.

65
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,333
EZIO: I am to please.

66
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,400
I'll let Antonio know about our progress.

67
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,066
Come find me later, I've got another job for you.

68
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,133
EZIO: What sort of job?

69
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,099
Meet me near the docks, and I'll explain.

70
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,466
EZIO: Molto bene.

71
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,266
EZIO: Leonardo!

72
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,233
Ezio, so good to see you.

73
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:14,900
How can I help you?

74
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,033
Ha ha, you found another one! How exciting!

75
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,966
If you transpose this word, and move this line to the left…

76
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:27,300
It's deciphered!

77
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:39,033
Rescuing my brothers was more than just an act of charity, Ezio.

78
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,733
The men you freed will play a vital role in the weeks to come.
