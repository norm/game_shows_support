  In a city famous for its towers, the Salvucci family, in a display of 13th
  Century might, erected not one but two. And not only did they erect two,
  they build them to be taller than the ruler of San Gimignano’s, the
  Podestà’s tower, despite a law made in 1255 that prohibited such an act of
  blatant brick and mortar-style aggression.

  Outraged, the Podestà forced the towers to be cut down until they were
  smaller than his.
