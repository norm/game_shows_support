  Completed in 1455 by Cosimo de' Medici’s live-in architect Michelosso di
  Bartolomeo Michelozzi, the Palazzo Medici was constructed as the private
  residence of the Medici family. It was designed according to the values of
  humanism, the dominant ideology of the Renaissance, which attempts to engage
  the viewer with structures built on a more human scale.

  At least, that’s the theoretical ideology of the palazzo, but, the effect
  goes something more like this: the outside is foreboding and keeps people
  out. If the façade could talk, it seems to be saying: “Get back! You do not
  belong here! You are not important enough to enter!”

  In contrast, the interior courtyard, which only the Medici and their guests
  saw, has none of the exterior’s hard edges, it’s full of luscious curving
  rounded arches, like a wedding cake. It says: “You’ve arrived, welcome to
  paradise!”

  In fact, Cosimo both approved the courtyard and rejected an earlier
  architectural plan by Brunelleschi that would have led to a more open
  façade. He wanted a Medici fortress inside Florence.
