  Founded in 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei, the monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore
  is Benedictine in practice. Benedictine monks are the most mainstream,
  practicing “peace, prayer, and work,” while living in autonomous communities
  with their own local government.

  Monte Oliveto Maggiore owned most of the land in the Siena region, so having
  its own private government would come in handy when dealing with such
  riches, as would a good lawyer. Fortunately, Bernardo Tolomei was a jurist,
  leaving the monastery in a very lucrative state by the time he died.
