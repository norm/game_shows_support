  Likely established sometime around the late 7th Century, Venice's
  lagoon-locked location was the result of Byzantine settlers attempting to
  hide from Lombard invaders. By the Middle Ages, the city had grown into a
  great naval power. Its strategic position at the top of the Adriatic meant
  that ships taking goods inland had to go through Venice, filling its coffers
  with money and commerce.

  Entering the late Middle Ages, Venice exercised influence over both its
  neighbouring states and the Church. When the Fourth Crusade rolled around in
  12 02, the crusaders required transport on Venice's ships, which the
  Venetian Doge, Enrico Dandolo, agreed to on the condition that the crusaders
  retake the Dalmatian city of Zadar and then capture Constantinople.

  When Constantinople fell, the city was sacked by the Venetian fleet, which
  stole, among other things, four bronze horses as ornaments for the Basilica
  San Marco. Now that's what I call a faith-based initiative.

  As Venice's wealth grew, so did its fleet. Through sea battles she gained
  Byzantine territory, Hungarian territory, and destroyed the Genoese fleet.
  Venice's fortunes were so entwined with the sea that every year the Doge
  would throw a ring into the lagoon while saying in Latin: We wed thee, sea,
  in the sign of the true and everlasting Lord. Despite much eye-raising
  about the godliness of sea-human relations, the Pope sanctioned the
  marriage.

  By the end of the 15th Century, Venice was quite possibly the wealthiest
  city in the world and the second-largest city in Europe after Paris, but the
  rest of Europe had had enough. France, Spain, Austria and Hungary, joined
  together in the League of Cambrai, partnering with Pope Julius II to crush
  Venice.
</p>

<p>
  But Venice was able to weather the storm, ultimately keeping her territories
  even after several disastrous defeats. But she would never expand again.
  Turkey attacked in the 18th Century, and Venice began a long decline which
  ultimately ended in 1797, when Austria took control of the Republic.
