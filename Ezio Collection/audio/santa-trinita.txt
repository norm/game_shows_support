  Constructed over an existing church in 1258, Santa Trinita (Holy Trinity) is
  known for its Sassetti chapel, which is decorated with frescos of the life
  of Saint Francis by Domenico Ghirlandaio, a painter most famous for his
  brief role as one of Michelangeloâ€™s teachers.

  Santa Trinita was the mother church of the Vallumbrosan order of monks, a
  very serious group that strictly enforced both poverty and silence, for
  life.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the beauty of the Santa Trinita frescos, very few Vallumbrosan monks
  are likely to have seen them, on account of the fact that the monks received
  beatings for going outside their monasteries.
