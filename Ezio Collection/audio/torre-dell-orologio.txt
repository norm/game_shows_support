  Constructed in the late 15th century as a display of Venice's wealth, the
  Torre dell'Orologio displays the time of day, the current phase of the
  moon, and for those of us who believe that all of human behaviour is
  governed by little shapes in the stars, the dominant sign of the Zodiac.

  According to legend, the designers of the clock face were blinded once their
  work was complete, so they could never duplicate it elsewhere. While this is
  probably bollocks, the designers did live inside the clock tower for the
  rest of their lives to maintain it.

  The Torre dell'Orologio ended up serving one very important practical
  purpose; it was used by sailors in the nearby harbour to time their
  departures with the tides.
