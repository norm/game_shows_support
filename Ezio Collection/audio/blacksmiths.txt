  Every Renaissance community needed a blacksmith. Swords, locks, pans,
  knives, nails, and armour were all made from metal and all needed to be
  shaped. In addition architectural ironwork flourished during the
  Renaissance as blacksmiths began to apply their practical craft towards
  making art.
