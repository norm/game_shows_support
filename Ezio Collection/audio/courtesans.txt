  Prostitution was one of the most popular occupations for Renaissance women,
  whose only other options in most cases were staying with their families or
  living in a convent. Italian society supported prostitution, and many
  brothels were regulated by the government. At the end of the 15th Century,
  cities started to pass laws against prostitution, forcing courtesans to wear
  specific outfits and separating them from respected society.
