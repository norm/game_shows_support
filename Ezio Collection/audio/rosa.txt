  Date of Birth: 14 60, Profession: Thief.

<p>
  The child of an unknown Venetian nobleman and a prostitute, Rosa grew up on
  her own in the streets of Venice. In 1475, she attempted to pickpocket the
  leader of the Venetian Thieves Guild and was caught red-handed. But,
  Antonio, instead of reporting her to the police, took her on as a pupil.

<p>
  He kept several logs of her training, noting that her ability to leap up
  from the street to seemingly unreachable windowsills "was unprecedented".
</p>

<p>
  In terms of her social skills, her vocabulary was "colourful to say the
  least". Apparently, she could also hold her own in a fight. Antonio writes
  that "the last of my thieves who tried to kiss her escaped with most of
  his mouth intact".
