  In a diary entry from 1474, Maria Auditore one of the great Florentine
  chroniclers and Etseo's mother, describes her son as "competitive, stubborn
  and loud mouthed, but so passionate that it is impossible to fault him for
  anything". Complaints to the city guard by several noble patricians seem to
  suggest he was also something of a womanizer.

<p>
  Tutored by the great banker Giovanni Tornabuoni, Ezio's school records cease
  around age 17, at which point his name is connected with some terrible
  crime.

<p>
  It is impossible to discern what it could be from the records, there's very
  little here, but afterward Ezio drops out of history entirely, as if he
  never existed.
