  Connected to the 13th Century Palazzo Vecchio del Podestà, the Torre Rognosa
  rises 51 meters above San Gimignano.

<p>
  Podestà (Power in English) was the title given to the appointed head of many
  Italian cities. The Palazzo Vecchio was the residence of the Podestà of San
  Gimignano for about 100 years, until, in 1337, he moved across the square
  into the Palazzo Comunale.

<p>
  Why would the Podestà simply abandon tradition like that? Perhaps because
  the Palazzo Comunale has the largest tower in San Gimignano.

  Tower Envy: do not underestimate it as a force for change.
