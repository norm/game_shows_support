  Originally built as a watchtower in the 9th Century, the Campanile di San
  Marco was later transformed into a bell tower. Each of the five bells has a
  special purpose: one announces the Senate, another announces midday, a third
  the opening and closing of the work day, the fourth council meetings, and
  the fifth and final bell: Executions.
