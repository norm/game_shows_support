<p>
  Date of Birth: 14 63, Profession: Countess of Forlì, Noble.
</p>

<p>
  A countess by marriage, Caterina was notorious far before she ever arrived
  in Forlì. Raised in the Court of Milan, she received a classical education
  while tutored in the art of war by her father, the Duke. At court, Caterina
  also acquired a passion for alchemy and hunting.
</p>

<p>
  In 1473, when she was 10-years-old, Caterina became engaged to Girolamo
  Riario, the Pope's nephew. They consummated their marriage when she was 14.
</p>

<p>
  Once in Rome, she was heralded as one of the most outgoing nobles at court,
  while her husband had a reputation for being one of the most ruthless. With
  the premature death of the Pope's brother, Girolamo gained even more power,
  securing the titles of Lord of Immola and Forlì.
</p>

<p>
  When the Pope died, looters sacked Rome, destroying Caterina's residence.
  Unafraid, despite being 7 months pregnant, Caterina rode on horseback to the
  Castel Sant'Angelo and defended the Vatican with cannon fire and soldiers.
</p>

<p>
  In 1484, she moved with her family to Forlì. Paid off by someone with a
  grievance against her husband, the Orsi Brothers killed Girolamo in 1488. As
  a result, Caterina became the ruler of Forlì and Immola.
</p>

<p>
  She wasted no time, winning the favour of nearby rulers, revising the tax
  system and training the militia herself. Although she advocated peace, when
  those around her were hurt she dealt fierce vengeance, frequently killing
  enemies' wives and children in punishment. While Forlì was under attack by
  Chezaray Borgyah the Pope's son, she sent the Pope a letter that had been
  rubbed with plague sores.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, Forlì and Caterina fell to Chezaray Borgyah in 1499. Caterina was
  captured and sent to Rodrigo Borgyah in Rome, who kept her imprisoned for a
  year and is rumoured to have raped her alongside his son. When she emerged
  from the Vatican, her hair had turned white.
</p>

<p>
  Exiled to Florence, Caterina died of pneumonia in 1509.
