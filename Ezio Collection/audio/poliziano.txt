  Somewhat of a prodigy, Poliziano learned Latin and Greek at age 10, and by
  18 had already become a published author. Lorenzo de' Medici hired him to
  act as the tutor for his children and made sure he received a post at the
  Studio Fiorentino.

  Unfortunately, Poliziano must not have been everyone's favourite instructor.
  He died of arsnic poisoning in 1494, probably murdered by Piero de' Medici,
  his former student.
