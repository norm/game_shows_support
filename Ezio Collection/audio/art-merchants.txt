  The shops of Renaissance artists were usually small, and dealt mainly in
  religious decorations for churches or homes. Artists were not considered
  visionaries as they are today, but were treated merely as craftsmen, just
  like carpenters and blacksmiths. The production of art was usually
  cooperative.

  The head of the shop was the master, who received commissions and oversaw
  the assembly of the painting. He was expected to be a businessman and turn a
  profit, usually creating copies of whatever religious paintings were in
  vogue at the time.
