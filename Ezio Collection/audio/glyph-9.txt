  Operation New Frontier.
</p>

<p>
  HQ has given the go-head to extract the resource. Negotiations are over.
  F is planning to give the vote to everyone. Reason just doesn't work with 
  someone like that.

<p>
  I'll send you the driver. We've trained him with PE2 in our labs, he
  shouldn't be any trouble.
</p>

<p>
  The motorcade root is marked below. Once the target has been downed,
  either by Oswald or Z, use PE1 to stage a distraction. Make some kind of
  phantom appear around this slope I've marked with an X.
</p>

<p>
  Freak people out.
  The driver will grab PE3 in the confusion.
