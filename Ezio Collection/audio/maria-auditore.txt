  "I grow tired of these walls that surround me and am bored with safety. Now,
  is the time to make a decision: I will go out there and see what my life may
  truly be."
</p>

<p>
  Maria wrote those words when she was 16, a week before she met Giovanni
  Auditore.

<p>
  Born into a powerful banking family, the Mozzi, Maria is one of the most
  famous historical sources of the time period due to her multi-volume diary,
  which has been translated by several notable scholars and is on display in
  the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.

  With funding from her parents, Maria opened up a bakery in the courtyard of
  her family palazzo, which she transformed into an artistic gathering place.
  It was there that she met "a man with such conviction I found myself rooted
  to the spot, unable to look anywhere else". That man was Giovanni Auditore.
</p>

  Maria and Giovanni were married in 1450. Maria's diary entries continue for
  the next few decades, describing her patronage of several up-and-coming
  artists and her trials as a mother, at which point she abruptly abandons her
  writing, to the disappointment of historians everywhere.
