  Probably built for medieval defence, the Torre del Diavolo once had a
  walkway at its summit. The wooden spikes around the top held the boards of
  the walkway in place.

  Depending upon who you ask, the name (the Devilâ€™s Tower) comes from either
  the fact that lightning once struck the tower, or that the original owner
  left on a trip, only to come back and find it slightly higher than when he
  left.
