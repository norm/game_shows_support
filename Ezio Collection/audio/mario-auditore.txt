  One of several condottieri patrolling the Tuscan countryside, Mario Auditore
  played a significant role in the Battle of Anghiari, alerting Micheletto
  Attendolo to the appearance of several dust clouds over the road which
  signalled a surprise advance by Milanese troops. Thanks to Mario, the
  Milanese attack was foiled and the Florentines won the battle.

  Although Mario sided with Florence in Anghiari, for most of his career he
  defended the interests of his hometown Monteriggioni, derailing Florentine
  attempts to seize Tuscan territory.

  While Mario's younger brother Giovanni moved to Florence in 1454 to pursue
  a career in banking, Mario stayed at the family's villa in Monteriggioni,
  stating in a letter to Giovanni that he "preferrred fighting like a man to
  filling out balance sheets".
