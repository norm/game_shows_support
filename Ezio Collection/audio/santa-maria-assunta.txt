  Referred to as the Duomo by locals, even though it doesnâ€™t deserve the title
  because the town has no bishop, Santa Maria Assunta was built in the 12th
  Century. Shockingly, it has no tower, although, in San Gimignano, the City
  of Towers, such an act of celibacy coming from a church was probably a smart
  move.
