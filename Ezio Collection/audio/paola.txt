  There isn't much information about Paola in the history books, but the
  Florentine archives reveal that she was orphaned at age 8 when her parents
  were killed at sea. Left with a choice between joining a nunnery and
  prostitution, she began a life on the streets.

<p>
  At 16, she vanishes from the records, only to reappear at age 20 when she
  was arrested for murdering a city guard. On an interesting note, Giovanni
  Auditore represented her in court, winning the case on a self-defense plea.

<p>
  Released from prison, Paola went on to start her own brothel to protect
  many other unfortunate women of the street.
