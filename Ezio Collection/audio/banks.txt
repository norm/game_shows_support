  With the advent of double entry bookkeeping, which allowed bankers to keep
  track of their clients' deposits and withdrawals, and the proliferation of
  many different types of Italian currency into the pool of circulation, banks
  became an essential part of everyday Renaissance life.

  Banks technically couldn't make money on their money, because the Catholic
  Church forbade the charging of interest, but in practice this restriction
  wasn't followed by bankers, or even by the Vatican which participated in
  the banking system and required banks to pay the Pope "gifts" in proportion
  to the amount of money he had deposited with them. As long as it isn't
  called "interest", God won't notice right?
