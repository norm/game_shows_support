  Leonardo da Vinci opened his own studio after completing his apprenticeship
  to Verrocchio, one of the most successful Florentine artists of the day.

  Between 1476 and 1481, Leonardo probably continued to collaborate with
  Verrocchio, although no one is quite sure what he was working on. In 1481,
  he was given his first commission by the monks of San Donato a Scoh peto, to
  paint The Adoration of the Magi.
