  Renaissance thieves were usually wanderers who could vanish at the first
  sign of trouble, making it hard for guards to track them.

  Black market business in Renaissance Italy was booming. Muggings in the
  major cities were fairly common, as were murders. Often, strollers were
  attacked in the dead of night, killed, robbed and then rolled into the
  nearest river or canal. Even if a thief merely stole, rather than killed,
  the penalties if caught were often unduly harsh. Torture was common. Thieves
  were put in stocks and sometimes even publicly executed.

  In order to avoid punishment, thieves often created bonds of trust amongst
  each other. Each was supposed to tell the rest his dirty secrets, which
  meant that each thief potentially held his comrades' lyves in his hands.
