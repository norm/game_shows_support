  Cristina Vespucci was a well-known Florentine beauty and a favourite of
  painters, most notably Botticelli, who used her as a model for several of
  his paintings. Records kept by her father's guards indicate Ezio visited her
  frequently and that he was "unbelievably dextrous", as the guards were never
  able to catch him trespassing.

  In addition to her looks, Cristina also seems to have been somewhat
  responsible for jumpstarting the career of her cousin, the namesake of a
  rather famous landmass. At a dinner party attended by Cristina and among
  other illustrious guests Lorenzo de' Medici, she was reputed to have been in
  conversation with Lorenzo and Manfredo Soderini about her cousin's
  brilliance as a sailor.

  Well apparently she exaggerated his importance slightly to impress
  Lorenzo, and Lorenzo, charmed by her beauty, agreed to hire him. "Try
  Amerigo out. I bet after several years you'll name your shipping company
  after him" she is reported to have joked.

<p>
  Biggest understatement of the century.
