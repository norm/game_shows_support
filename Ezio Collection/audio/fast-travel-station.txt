  Venice is situated on a series of islands surrounded by a lagoon, requiring
  travellers arriving or departing to take a traghetti (ferry). Traghetti come
  in all sizes, from the small ferries that shuttle people around the city to
  large ships that carry passengers to and from the mainland.
</p>

<p>
  Traghetto stations were run by guilds, which enacted all kinds of laws to
  make sure that only the most connected members had the lucrative privilege
  of working at a station.
</p>

<p>
  Each station had its own rules, which could range from allowing only people
  40 years of age and older to work there, to forcing pilots to only carry 10
  passengers per ship.
