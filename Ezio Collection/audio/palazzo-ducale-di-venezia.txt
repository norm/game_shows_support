  The Palazzo Ducale was constructed from 1309-1424, in the Gothic style, as
  the residence for the Doge eh, or, rather, his prison, since the Doge eh was
  rarely allowed to leave once elected.

  The Doge eh was the highest ranking elder in Venice and served in his position
  for life. In 1172, the selection of the Doge eh became entrusted to a committee
  of 40 (the Forty), whose members were chosen by the Venetian Great Council.

  Venice liked to think of itself as a Republic, meaning that the people could
  participate in the government. When the Doge eh took office he was introduced
  to the people with the words: "This is the Doge eh, if it please you." In fact,
  members of the Great Council were appointed by the forty, which in turn
  chose the Forty. See the problem there?
</p>

<p>
  Candidates for the Great Council were selected from a microscopic pool
  containing only noble families and although the Doge eh could nominate anyone
  to the Council, the Forty and the Council itself had to approve the
  nomination. Because the general population was largely uneducated, the
  election rules were purposefully complicated, and the Council controlled the
  guards, Venice followed the historical norm: the people got screwed.
