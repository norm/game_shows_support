<p>
  Date of Birth: 14 49, Profession, Ruler of Florence.
</p>

<p>
  Simultaneously keeping the dream of the Florentine Republic alive while
  leaving the people with very little legitimate power, Lorenzo de' Medici
  deftly ruled Renaissance Florence during its Golden Age.
</p>

<p>
  Lorenzo's grandfather, Cosimo, built the Medici Bank, creating one of the
  most powerful financial institutions in Europe and becoming fabulously rich
  in the process.
</p>

<p>
  Considered the smartest of Cosimo's grandchildren, Lorenzo was already being
  sent on diplomatic missions as a child. Although his father was inept and
  sickly, his mother was a poet. She introduced Lorenzo to many of the
  prominent artists of the day, instilling in him a love of art and culture.
</p>

<p>
  In 1469, when he was only twenty, Lorenzo became the head of the Medici
  family, at which point he quickly gained control of the Florentine
  government through friends in the city council, payoffs, strategic
  marriages, and threats. But Florence prospered with Lorenzo as its
  puppeteer. A peace was made between the warring states of Italy and several
  masterpieces of Renaissance art by the likes of Botticelli and Michelangelo
  were made under his care.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, Lorenzo was happier writing poetry and shadow governing than
  directing his family's bank. During his lifetime, several branches of the
  bank collapsed and the Medici assets were wasted on frivolities such as
  jousting tournaments.
</p>

<p>
  Lorenzo died in 1492. Nearly broke, he was unable to prevent the popular
  backlash against his rich lifestyle and the mad monk Savonarola's rise to
  power.
