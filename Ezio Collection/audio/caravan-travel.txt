  Travel in the Renaissance was not the disgusting ordeal it is today.
  Instead, it was merely terrifying. The countryside was filled with bandits,
  causing most travellers to move in armed groups called caravans. Anxious
  voyagers usually sewed valuables and gold into the soles of their shoes or
  the lining of their jackets.

  Guides called Vetturini were sometimes hired to help plot the root of the
  caravans and book rooms at local inns, but those carriers were often working
  with the bandits, just like travel agents today.
