  Completed in 1473, the Palazzo Auditore is notable for its rusticated
  stonework and Roman pilasters. Giovanni Auditore designed the palazzo
  himself, based on initial sketches by Leone Battista Alberti.

  Once built, the palazzo became a fixture of the Santa Maria Novella
  district. Lorenzo de' Medici mentioned in a letter addressed to Giovanni
  dated 14 74, that he admired the façade’s lack of “ostentation”.
