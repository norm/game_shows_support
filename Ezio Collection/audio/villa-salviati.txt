  Made wealthy through his connections to the Pope, Archbishop Francesco
  Salviati purchased this Tuscan villa in 1475 in anticipation of becoming
  archbishop of Florence. He spent the next few years having it renovated in
  the Tuscan style, while plotting with the Pazzi family to invade Florence.
  Sadly, this left him very little time to enjoy it before his inevitable
  demise.

  After the conspiracy went south, archival documents indicate that Salviati
  swapped his archbishop outfit with one of the residents of Florence, who
  was then lynched in his place, while he escaped to his villa.
