  Venetian naval strategy involved maintaining a steady chain of bases along
  their trade roots to the East, ensuring that its merchants were able to get
  there and back without being attacked by pirates or Venice's enemies, the

  By the end of the 15th Century, Venice's fleet was occupied trying to force
  Charles VIII of France out of Italy, at which point, Turkish forces struck

  Italy. Although Venice was able to keep most of its territory, from that
  point forward, it would never again be a great naval power.
