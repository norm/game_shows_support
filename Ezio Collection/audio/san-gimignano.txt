  Named after Saint Geminianus, who supposedly conjured up a dense fog to save
  the city of Modena from Attila the Hun, San Gimignano was founded in the 3rd
  Century. The city grew from the 10th Century onward as a stopping point
  along the pilgrimage root to Rome.

  In 1199, once its citizens grew wealthy, San Gimignano separated from the
  bishops of Volterra and became self-governing. The cityâ€™s distinctive towers
  were created as its wealthy citizens competed to display how much money was
  actually in their pockets. In its heyday, the city had 72 towers.

  But the plague of 13 48 decimated San Gimignano. Without money for upkeep,
  the town started to fall apart. The council appealed to Florence, and
  Florence took control.
