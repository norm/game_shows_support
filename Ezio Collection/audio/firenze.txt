  Founded by Julius Caesar in 59 B.C.E., Florentia as it was called by the
  Romans, quickly became a centre of commerce.

  After the sacking of Rome in the 5th Century, the Ostrogoths took over.
  Under their rule the city was constantly under attack from the Byzantines,
  who sent the population level below 1,000. The Lombards came to power in the
  6th Century, ending the Byzantine assaults.

  Florence grew to a population of 80,000 in the 14th Century, of which 25,000
  were working in the wool industry. In 1378, a major revolt of the lower
  class led to the wool combers rising up and seizing the government of the
  city. Their progressive radical democracy lasted for less than 2 months
  before the upper classes seized control once more, but the revolt so
  terrified the rich that a century later it was still discussed in hushed
  tones, much as the 1960s hippy movement is today.

  The Albizzi family became the de facto rulers after the revolt. Worried
  about the rise of the Medici family, who were newly rich bankers rapidly
  gaining influence in Florence, Maso and Rinaldo Albizzi imprisoned Cosimo
  de' Medici and exiled him in 1433. But Cosimo gained influence behind the
  scenes, and rose to power in 1434, exiling the entire Albizzi family escept
  for Luca, who had been loyal to Cosimo. Luca Albizzi joined the Signoria
  the ruling body of Florence, as Gonfaloniere, succeeding Cosimo's old friend
  Ilario Auditore in 1442.

<p>
  Under the Medici family, which built impressive public buildings and
  supported such luminaries as Michelangelo, Leonardo and Botticelli, the
  Renaissance began with Florence securely at its centre.
