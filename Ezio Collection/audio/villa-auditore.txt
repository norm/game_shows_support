  Constructed in 1290, the Villa Auditore is an important medieval predecessor
  to early Renaissance architecture. The Villa’s wonderful symmetry and
  ordered geometry were a revelation for its time.

  Not only concerned with aesthetics, Domenico Auditore, Ezio Auditore’s
  great-grandfather, designed his home to double as a fortress and training
  ground, looking out both over the city that it protects and the Tuscan
  plains.

  After a Florentine attack in 1320 left the façade damaged, the present
  façade was erected and a painting gallery was added to the interior.

  Domenico was more than just an architect and a warrior; he was also a
  skilled engineer. Recently discovered hidden compartments and rooms with
  mechanisms blocking entry are several unique features of the building that
  make it a technological marvel as well as an architectural one.
