  Giovanni Auditore was one of the pivotal figures in 15th Century Florentine
  banking. In charge of overseeing the Medici bank branches across Italy, he
  kept the Medici machine running while Lorenzo was busy with the government.
  Extending his reach out into the international operation, it was Giovanni
  who first noticed the problems with the Lyon bank, causing him to alert
  Francesco Sassetti, which saved the branch.

  Such great talent was well rewarded by Il Magnifico. Giovanni developed a
  close friendship with Lorenzo de' Medici, becoming one of his closest
  advisors. Successful negotiations to secure the Pope's support of the Medici
  bank in 1471 were carried out by Giovanni.
