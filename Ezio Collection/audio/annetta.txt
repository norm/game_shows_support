  The Auditore family's live-in servant, Annetta, had one of the few
  respectable jobs allowed to lower-class Renaissance women. Rich families
  seldom had more than one or two servants. Most were young, sometimes
  children. Many hoped their masters would help raise their standing, but
  usually turnover was rapid.

  Ultimately, very little is known about Annetta's life. She passed on without
  making a mark on history.
