  A Venetian native, Alvise worked as a baggage handler for several years,

  After a heavy night of drinking, Alvise awoke to Turkish cannon fire
  bombarding the town. Panicking while running across the deck, he tripped,
  hit his head, and drowned.

  When it became clear Venice had lost the battle, he was accused of
  negligence by the ship's captain and erased from the logs of the navy.
