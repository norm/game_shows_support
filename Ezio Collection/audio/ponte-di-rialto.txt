  The oldest, and the most famous bridge in Venice, the Rialto is the
  dividing line between the districts of San Marco and San Polo. The bridge is
  notable not only for the size of its large arch, but also for its main
  walkway lined with shops and stalls, which was a vibrant strolling and
  meeting place for the community around it.

  Contrast that with todayâ€™s Rialto, where crowd of tourists fight over cheap
  knockoffs of Venetian glass while some idiot attempts to spit off the edge
  of the bridge onto passing boats. Ah, modernity.
