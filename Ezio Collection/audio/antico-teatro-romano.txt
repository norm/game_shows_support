  Inspired by Greek theatres, which had a similar structure, ruins of Ancient
  Roman theatres can be found throughout the territories once ruled by the
  Empire. Typical Roman theatres were constructed of concrete, a material no
  longer used in Renaissance Italy because the recipe had been lost. Their
  semicircular design created superior acoustics, allowing spectators to hear
  the plays, speeches, or choral events performed on stage.

  Notice the lack of marble? Renaissance Italians practiced a rudimentary form
  of recycling when dealing with Roman structures: any marble that could be
  found was ripped off the buildings to be reused for free.
