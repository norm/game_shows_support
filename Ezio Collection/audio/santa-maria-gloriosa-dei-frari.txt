  Built by Franciscan monks, Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (The Frari for
  short) is the second largest church in Venice. Following the guidelines of
  St Francis, who advocated poverty, the church has very basic exterior
  decoration.

  It is rumored that in the 15th century, the Frari housed a hidden tomb,
  which has since collapsed.
