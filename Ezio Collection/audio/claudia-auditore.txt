  The third child of Giovanni and Maria Auditore, and the first girl in the
  family, Claudia seems to have been a bit of a spoiled brat. It looks like
  her parents had to raise her dowry by 1000 florins after she scared away all
  her potential suitors.

<p>
  A report from her school indicates she once attacked another girl for
  looking at her boyfriend, and knocked her out cold.

<p>
  On the plus side, she's Etseo's sister, so you should be safe.
