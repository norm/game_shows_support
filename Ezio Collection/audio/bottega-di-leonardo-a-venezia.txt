  During his brief stay in Venice, Leonardo da Vinci was a paid military
  engineer for the Venetian army, and claimed to be working on a painting of
  the famous Isabella dâ€™Este, of whom he had made a cartoon while visiting
  Mantua. Despite promising her repeatedly that he was hard at work, no
  painting ever materialized.

  Although many history books claim Leonardo only visited Venice once, it
  seems that he used his workshop there as a sort of secret retreat, returning
  to it repeatedly during his life.
