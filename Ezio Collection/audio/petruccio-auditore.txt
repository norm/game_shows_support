  The youngest of the Auditore children, Petrucio was described as "having a
  weak constitution" by Giovanni Auditore in a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici
  soon after the boy's birth.

  Apparently, he didn't improve with time. Petrucio was pulled from school
  due to illness when he was 12 and according to records from the family
  doctor was confined to bed. No other data exists after that, so it is
  probable that he eventually succumbed to his illness.
