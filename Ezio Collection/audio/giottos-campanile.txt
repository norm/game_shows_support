  Begun by Giotto di Bondone (the famous architect and painter) in 1334, this
  famous gothic bell tower was incomplete when Giotto died. Andrea Pisano took
  over and then in 1348 was felled by the Black Death.

  In 1359, the tower was completed by Francesco Talenti, who deviated from
  Giotto’s plan in his design of the upper three floors. He enlarged each
  floor to match the previous according to perspective so when seen from
  below, all three floors seem to be exactly the same size.

  The tower is clad with white marble from Carrara, red marble from Siena and
  green marble from Prato. It takes exactly 414 steps to reach the top,
  perhaps predicting Charles Messier’s discovery of the Whirlpool Galaxy
  exactly 414 years later. Or perhaps not.
