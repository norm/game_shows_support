  There is almost no trace of La Volpey (The Fox) in the history books. The
  name's obviously a pseudonym, but for whom is anyone's guess. What small
  data is available seems to be almost mythical.

  La Volpey is reported to have robbed the Pope's carriage without any of his
  guards noticing, including the Pope, who was sitting inside the carriage.
  One night in 1467, he was seen on the rooftops of the Palazzo della
  Signoria, the Palazzo Medici, and Santa Croce, all at the same time. Some
  claim that he's immortal, never aging, while others say that his violet eyes
  can see through buildings, perusing the contents inside.
