  Etseo's older brother and the eldest Auditore, Federico entered the Medici
  bank as a clerk when he was 19. However, the bank logs indicate he mostly
  dicked around rather than actually working.

  One entry goes into detail. On September 17, 1475, a bag of gold florins
  went missing: "After panic struck the bank, the elder Auditore approached
  Francesco Sassetti, and with a smile revealed the location of the bag, which
  had been hidden on the rooftop! If he weren't the son of Giovanni Auditore,
  I'd speak to Lorenzo de' Medici and have him put in the stocks!"

  Unsurprisingly, Federico was removed from the bank's payroll shortly after
  his 20th birthday.
