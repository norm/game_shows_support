  The illegitimate son of a notary and a peasant woman, Leonardo da Vinci was
  raised in Tuscany. Like many destined to be superstars, he had no surname,
  Vinci being the town in which he was born.

  At age 14 he was apprenticed to a Florentine painter Verrocchio, who taught
  him chemistry drafting painting sculpting and modelling. When he was 20
  Leonardo established his own workshop and then travelled across Italy,
  eventually painting his great masterpieces "The Last Supper" in 1498 and
  "The Mona Lisa" in 1503 to 07.

  During his travels, Leonardo studied the world with unquenchable curiosity,
  recording his observations in mirror writing within his notebooks. He
  created designs for a helicopter tank solar power and a calculator, among
  others. He was also an engineer, designing garrisons cannons and movable
  barricades.

  Despite this epic list of accomplishments, Leonardo was hounded by his
  patrons for his chronic procrastination. Pieces frequently took years longer
  than he anticipated and many were never finished at all.

  Leonardo also had a tumultuous love life. Accused of sodomy in 1476, he was
  most likely homosexual. Salai his assistant, was accused of stealing and
  spending too much money on clothes but was also probably Leonardo's lover.
  Leonardo painted several pictures of Salai, including his famous "St. John
  the Baptist", and left "The Mona Lisa" to him when he died in 1519.
