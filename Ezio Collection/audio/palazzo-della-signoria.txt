  Arnolfo di Cambio designed the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the
  Palazzo Vecchio) in 1299, for the rulers of Florence, the Signoria.
</p>

<p>
  The Signoria was made up of nine members (or Priori) selected by the cityâ€™s
  guilds, two from each district, and a Gonfalonier of Justice. Members were
  supposed to be chosen by lot, but once the Medici family took power, only
  their friends seemed to end up in the drawing. Government by the people,
  right?

  Interesting fact: The tower in front is off-centre because it was
  incorporated into the Palazzo from an earlier structure. It contains two
  small cells, one of which was used to imprison Cosimo de' Medici.
