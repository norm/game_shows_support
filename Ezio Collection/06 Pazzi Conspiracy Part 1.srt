1
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,833
EZIO: Buon giorno.

2
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,466
ARCHITECT: Salute, Ser Ezio. Shall we take a look at the list?

3
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,933
ARCHITECT: Buon viaggio!

4
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,066
MARIO: Ezio! Ha, ha, come in, come in!

5
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,866
MARIO: To what do we owe the honour?

6
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,533
I have been sent from Firenze by El Magnifico
to attend to some unfinished business.

7
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,566
I'm looking for Jacopo de' Pazzi.

8
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,633
Ha! Who isn't?

9
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,533
We've been at it for days.

10
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,933
EZIO: Then perhaps what I carry will help up us both.

11
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,300
A list of his co-conspirators.

12
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,433
One of them will talk before he dies.

13
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,766
Excellent, these men are sure to lack Jacopo's resources.

14
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,566
Which means they will be easier to find.

15
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,699
I will put my scouts to it at once.

16
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,266
I appreciate the help, Uncle.

17
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:29,833
I've got something else for you as well, more Codex pages.

18
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,533
Ah, let's see what we can learn.

19
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,400
What is this?

20
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,666
What "prophet"?

21
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,933
EZIO: What did you find, Uncle?

22
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,133
Just another damn mystery.

23
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:44,433
The text here roughly translates to "Only the prophet may open it."

24
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,633
There's reference to two pieces of Eden.

25
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,366
But these pages offer no answers, nipote.

26
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:52,900
At least not on their own, you must find more.

27
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,666
We'll have to save it for another day, uncle.

28
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,300
I have a mission to attend to.

29
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,533
As you wish.

30
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:05,366
Now, if you hope to defeat these bastardi, I will need to teach you a few things.

31
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,333
Meet me on the practice field.

32
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,500
MARIO: Alright Ezio, you're familiar with counterattacking.

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,866
MARIO: But what happens when your enemy is as well?

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,833
EZIO: I don't usually give them the opportunity.

35
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:28,133
MARIO: Tough talk offers little protection against Templar steel.

36
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,533
EZIO: Then by all means maestro, teach me what to do.

37
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,899
MARIO: Now, dodge!

38
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,800
Magnifico (magnificent)!

39
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,100
Once again, you exceed my expectations.

40
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:38,133
Signore, we've found Jacopo's men, and await your word to strike!

41
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,333
MARIO: Relay the following.

42
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,199
MARIO: No man moves until they have spoken with Ezio, intesi (understand)?

43
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,933
MERCENARY: It will be done.

44
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,600
MARIO: Go Ezio, visit with my mercenaries in the countryside.

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,199
MARIO: See if Jacopo's lackeys won't lead you to him.

46
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,100
MARIO: But be careful, they will be expecting you.

47
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:17,600
Ezio, about time you got here, we've found Bernardo Baroncelli.

48
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,700
EZIO: Ottima notizia (This is good news)!

49
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,466
EZIO: Tell me where he is and I'll see that he's dealt with.

50
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,399
MERCENARY: That's the trouble, Lorenzo actually had him arrested days ago.

51
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,066
MERCENARY: After being returned to us from Constantinople, but he escaped.

52
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,799
MERCENARY: We believe him to be somewhere inside San Gimignano.

53
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,166
EZIO: Va bene, I'll see if I can't pin him down.

54
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,533
MERCENARY: How do you expect to succeed where the rest of us have failed?

55
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,466
EZIO: I have my ways.

56
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,966
BERNARDO: I just need to take things one day at a time.

57
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:26,700
BERNARDO: He'll get bored, and lost, confused, distracted, killed.

58
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,266
BERNARDO: It'll be okay.

59
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:32,033
BERNARDO: And if he does come, if it happens, I'll keep moving.

60
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,133
BERNARDO: Never in one place for long.

61
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:39,633
BERNARDO: Only … only how to sleep, when to sleep, where to sleep?

62
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,399
BERNARDO: The guard tower, perhaps?

63
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,033
BERNARDO: They'll think me mad, they don't know.

64
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,799
BERNARDO: I'll pay them, yes, then what will it matter?

65
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,833
BERNARDO: All they care about is coin.

66
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,266
BERNARDO: All anyone cares about is coin.

67
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,633
BERNARDO: Good for the brotherhood, good for me.

68
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,366
BERNARDO: Safer this way, yes.

69
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,366
BERNARDO: Yes, I'll ask and then…

70
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,533
BERNARDO: I will be protected.

71
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,899
BERNARDO: We'll meet when it's time and I'll leave this place.

72
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,200
BERNARDO: Free, in time, in time.

73
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,133
BERNARDO: Wait! What is that?

74
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,566
BERNARDO: I saw something!

75
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:14,033
BERNARDO: Another mercenario come to spy on me!

76
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,500
BERNARDO: No, no, just my nerves.

77
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,766
BERNARDO: Hard to stay calm, knowing that he seeks me.

78
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:25,500
BERNARDO: I must stay focused and soon this will be done, soon.

79
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,233
BERNARDO: I knew you would come.

80
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,966
EZIO: Where is Jacopo?

81
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:59,433
BERNARDO: So you can do to him what you've done to me?

82
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,633
EZIO: There is still time for you to clear your conscience.

83
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:05,899
BERNARDO: We gather at the church when a meeting is called.

84
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,133
EZIO: Mi duole dover giungere a tanto (I am sorry that it came to this).

85
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,366
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

86
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,000
SUBJECT 16: It's getting easier and easier to hack into Abstergo's mainframe.

87
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:20,433
SUBJECT 16: It's like I know what data I'm looking for, I've already lived it.

88
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,866
SUBJECT 16: Do you see what's going on?

89
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,200
SUBJECT 16: Not yet, but you will.

90
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,633
Salute Ezio, Antonio Maffei has sought refuge atop the city's tallest structure.

91
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:51,466
Spouting scripture and arrows in equal measure.

92
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,833
The man has clearly lost his mind.

93
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,133
Making matters worse, he's posted archers all around him.

94
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,066
You would do well to clear them out before approaching.

95
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,133
EZIO: Grazie for the information.

96
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,233
SUBJECT 16: They were mostly heroes.

97
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,433
SUBJECT 16: See how the lineages disrupted it?

98
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,733
SUBJECT 16: The web of history traps the good.

99
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:55,900
SUBJECT 16: And the evil take what is not theirs!

100
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:01,000
SUBJECT 16: Behold! The mark of Cain.

101
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,033
ANTONIO: Citizens of San Gimignano, heed well my words!

102
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:18,666
ANTONIO: You must repent! Repent, and seek forgiveness!

103
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:22,966
ANTONIO: For your wicked ways have incurred the wrath of a demon!

104
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:29,300
ANTONIO: Summoned by your sins,
he now walks our world cloaked in shadow and darkness!

105
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,000
ANTONIO: And everywhere he treads death follows.

106
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,500
ANTONIO: Why you ask? Because you have strayed,
and sacrified your liberty to that wretch Lorenzo de' Medici!

107
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,500
ANTONIO: You are puppets, enslaved by purse strings!

108
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,699
ANTONIO: Won over by poisonous words!

109
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:54,000
ANTONIO: You have lost your virtue, you have lost your dignity!

110
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,933
ANTONIO: You have lost your faith, and this draws the demons in to feast!

111
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:06,033
ANTONIO: And feed they will, all whilst you wander lost in ignorance.

112
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:10,666
ANTONIO: Know that good men have died protecting you from his evil.

113
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:15,666
ANTONIO: Men who sought to save these lands, to purify them!

114
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,000
ANTONIO: Join me in prayer, my children.

115
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,500
ANTONIO: So that together we might stand against this darkness.

116
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,566
ANTONIO: Give ear O Heaven, and I will speak.

117
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:32,933
ANTONIO: And hear O Earth, the words of my mouth.

118
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:38,900
ANTONIO: Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew.

119
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,633
ANTONIO: As raindrops on the tender herb and as showers on the grass.

120
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:50,699
ANTONIO: For I proclaim the name of the Lord, ascribe greatness to our God.

121
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:55,633
ANTONIO: He is the rock, His work is perfect.

122
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:59,000
ANTONIO: For all His ways are justice.

123
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,833
ANTONIO: A God of truth and without injustice.

124
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,933
ANTONIO: Righteous and upright is He.

125
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:09,000
ANTONIO: They have corrupted themselves.

126
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,066
ANTONIO: They are not His children because of their blemish.

127
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:16,533
ANTONIO: A perverse and crooked generation.

128
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:22,900
ANTONIO: Do you thus deal with the Lord, O foolish and unwise people?

129
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,166
ANTONIO: Is He not your father, who bought you?

130
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,400
ANTONIO: Has He not made you and established you?

131
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:37,166
ANTONIO: By the light of the Lord be cleansed!

132
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,666
EZIO: No grazie.

133
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:42,766
ANTONIO: I will put you on your knees, sinner.

134
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:46,900
EZIO: You would enjoy that, wouldn't you?

135
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,066
ANTONIO: Beg forgiveness!

136
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,000
EZIO: I have no need to.

137
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,400
ANTONIO: Give me strength, O Lord, that I might cast out this demon.

138
00:42:57,966 --> 00:43:01,533
ANTONIO: It is not too late for you to turn away from evil!

139
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:04,966
ANTONIO: Repent, sinner, and you may yet be forgiven.

140
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:08,666
ANTONIO: I do God's work and it is good.

141
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,966
ANTONIO: Away with you, demon.

142
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:26,066
EZIO: Have some respect for death, my friend.

143
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:27,533
ANTONIO: I'll show you respect!

144
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,566
EZIO: No, I will.

145
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:35,666
EZIO: Che tu possa alfine trovare riposo nel corpo e nella mente
(May your body and mind at last be still).

146
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,699
EZIO: Requiescat in pace.

147
00:47:56,333 --> 00:48:01,333
Ah, there you are. Listen, we've found Stefano da Bagnone.
