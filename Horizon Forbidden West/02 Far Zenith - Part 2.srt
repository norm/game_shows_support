1
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,238
VOICE: Operation Phase One.

2
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:27,193
VOICE: Establish an asset within Project Zero Dawn. Status: complete.

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:32,065
VOICE: Phase Two. The asset will secretly beamcast
a complete copy of Gaia…

4
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,719
VOICE: …and her subordinate functions to this facility's data centre.

5
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,490
VOICE: If all goes well, Zero Dawn staff will remain
completely unaware of the transmission.

6
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,828
I thought Elisabet sent the backup here, but she didn't.

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,832
Far Zenith stole Gaia.

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,889
VARL: So … you said this backup is the last hope?

9
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:57,741
ALOY: Yeah.

10
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:03,496
ALOY: All those places I've been these last few months,
they were supposed to be more backups.

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:09,302
ALOY: But a thousand years ago, a guy named Ted Faro purged them all.

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,771
VARL: Was he part of Far Zenith, too?

13
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,758
ALOY: No, he was worse.

14
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,193
ALOY: Looks like we can cross over here.

15
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,186
VARL: Wow.

16
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,891
VARL: That big metal thing looks like the ship
we saw back in the auditorium.

17
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,177
VARL: Imagine going up to the stars in that!

18
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,382
ALOY: More Oseram.

19
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,385
ALOY: Machines tore right through them.

20
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,188
VARL: These guys couldn't catch a break.

21
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,185
VARL: Machines patrolling ahead.

22
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,039
ALOY: We can tag them in the Focus to keep track of them.

23
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,392
ALOY: Sneaky one.

24
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,781
ALOY: Okay, now how to get out of here?

25
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:31,791
VARL: Machine ripped right through the wall.

26
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,117
VARL: There's a ladder in the back.

27
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,179
ALOY: So tell me something.

28
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,967
ALOY: Sona was really okay with you
not going back to the Sacred Lands?

29
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,555
VARL: As the Nora War-Chief she understood
why I was obligated to follow you.

30
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:22,775
VARL: But as my mother, she wasn't pleased.

31
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,679
ALOY: Is she ever pleased? I don't think I've seen her smile.

32
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,598
VARL: Me neither.

33
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,587
VARL: Three of those things?!

34
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,141
VARL: If they slaughtered all those Oseram,
we'll never get through to the data centre.

35
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,794
There's no way to slip past them.

36
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,563
They're too tough to fight head on.

37
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,900
We could find a settlement, convince some hunters to help us.

38
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,786
That would take weeks, and we don't have that kind of time.

39
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,490
ALOY: Maybe all we need is that shuttle to fall.

40
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,427
VARL: That thing? How?

41
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,562
ALOY: We'll figure it out. Just wait here.

42
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,164
VARL: Aloy!

43
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,099
ALOY: Trust me.

44
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,688
ALOY: Just need to get over to the shuttle to figure out
how to make it fall into the basin.

45
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,412
And there she goes.

46
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,776
If I can make it to that tower,
I should be able to find a way across to the shuttle.

47
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,157
Maybe I should stick to my spear for now, saves some ammo.

48
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:47,293
There, that ladder can get me up to the tower.

49
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,099
Okay, there's a rail up there.

50
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:14,386
I think I can reach it if I launch myself off that grapple point.

51
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,292
Got it!

52
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,079
[groaning metal]

53
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,681
Well, that sounds good.

54
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,777
The storm is getting bad.

55
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:30,079
Hah, made it!

56
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,590
Easy.

57
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:03,395
There is a cable here, maybe I can ride it to the other side.

58
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,232
Uhhh…

59
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,855
AAH! Oof!

60
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,792
Well, nowhere to go but up!

61
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,645
This place is barely holding together.

62
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:23,983
Whoa.

63
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,450
Looks like there are massive clamps holding the shuttle in place.

64
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,187
I'll bet there's a control console nearby.

65
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,041
If I can release the clamps, the shuttle should fall…

66
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,392
…right into the basin!

67
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,806
Ah, great. More machines in my way.

68
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,987
Okay. Got this place to myself now.

69
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,707
Control console might be in there.

70
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:48,096
Okay, time to crush those machines down below.

71
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,480
The shuttle's caught up in those cables.

72
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,219
I'm going to have to climb the tower to find a way to disconnect them.

73
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,650
Scanning with my Focus could help here.

74
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,109
Gotta climb closer to the shuttle to detach the cables.

75
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,758
Okay, that doesn't sound good. Better detach those cables quick!

76
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,140
This should be the right spot.

77
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,227
There!

78
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,130
That connector's holding the cables together.

79
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:37,833
It should break if I shoot it.

80
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,166
One down.

81
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,337
Now I just need to climb higher to detach the second set of cables.

82
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:07,562
Scaling an ancient rickety tower
with killer machines waiting down below.

83
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,248
Oh, maybe Varl was right.

84
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:12,334
No turning back now.

85
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,533
Almost there!

86
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,453
There's the other connector.

87
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,210
Umm…

88
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,582
No, no!

89
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,095
Oh shit! Shit! Shit!

90
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,657
Not going anywhere, are you?

91
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,544
Finishing this the hard way.

92
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:07,182
I need to take this thing down to get the data centre!

93
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,084
I'll scan for weak spots.

94
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,372
Okay, where's that weak spot?!

95
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,272
That sac's full of acid. I should target it first.

96
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,554
Watch out for that acid!

97
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,149
Whoa! Still got some fight left in you!

98
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,993
Hah! Try spitting at me now!

99
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:13,641
There! Those canisters are exposed now, I should aim for them.

100
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,559
Damn it, it broke free!

101
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,644
Got to take this thing down, fast!

102
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,914
Trap, maybe? Frost ammo?

103
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,568
Or my Focus might find something I can use around here.

104
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,175
How do you like that?!

105
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,720
It's dead. Finally!

106
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,830
The data centre should be straight ahead.

107
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,717
I guess Varl's gonna have to find another way there.

108
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,326
Once I get the backup, I can reboot Gaia.

109
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,895
Fix the system, heal the blight.

110
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,814
Restore Elisabet's dream.

111
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,667
But is it still there?

112
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,828
Okay, I should find the server room.

113
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,184
I'm close, I have to be.

114
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,473
Please be here!

115
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,027
It's here!

116
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:37,468
GAIA: Gaia version 6.9 initialising.

117
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:39,971
GAIA: Hello.

118
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:41,422
ALOY: Hi!

119
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,594
ALOY: Elisabet?

120
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,148
ALOY: Travis Tate.

121
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,885
TATE: Now, what's this we got here?

122
00:35:53,885 --> 00:36:00,007
A Far Zenith conspiracy to steal a copy of Gaia,
and her subordinate functions?

123
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,176
Naughty, naughty!

124
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,996
You want me to handle this, Liz?

125
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:11,652
Blasphemers! Brood of vipers!

126
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:17,275
With a mighty hand I smite and pour troubles upon you.

127
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,864
[pew pew pew]

128
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:37,862
This ain't no copy of Gaia you stole, you losers.

129
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,148
But it's the mother of all logic bombs!

130
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:44,335
So good luck repairing your data.

131
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:47,872
And next time you start thinking you can outsmart a Tate?

132
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,057
Remember my salute!

133
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,324
VARL: Aloy?

134
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,379
The Goddess!

135
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,231
ALOY: There is no Goddess!

136
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,700
ALOY: I told you that already.

137
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,802
That's not Gaia.

138
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,288
ALOY: It's not what I'm looking for.

139
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,890
ALOY: It's nothing but a fake!

140
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,471
I got it.

141
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,057
ALOY: Varl…

142
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:57,708
I'm sorry.

143
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,244
VARL: You have a sharp bite sometimes, you know.

144
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:05,983
But it was pretty amazing to see you
fly off that tower and blow up the entire basin.

145
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,454
ALOY: The thing is, um, there's going to be more of that.

146
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,358
ALOY: I'm out of leads, Varl.

147
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,245
ALOY: But I have to keep searching and fast.

148
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:21,465
ALOY: And whatever risks I have to take, I will.

149
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,468
ALOY: And it doesn't make sense to have someone with me.

150
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,138
ALOY: Someone who might get hurt.

151
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,458
ALOY: This is on me Varl, nobody else.

152
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,545
VARL: Hold on!

153
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,132
VARL: Before, in Meridian, you said there was a man who helped you.

154
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,467
VARL: Sylens.

155
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,537
VARL: You said you used to talk to him a lot,
about things you discovered from the Old World.

156
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:45,656
VARL: Things no-one else understands.

157
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,243
VARL: And he gave you the lance you used to defeat Hades.

158
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,861
ALOY: He's gone, Varl.

159
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,331
ALOY: I haven't heard from him since the battle against Hades.

160
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:58,169
VARL: Sure, but spymaster Marad back in Meridian,
he's good at finding people, isn't he?

161
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,553
ALOY: Varl, I…

162
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,423
VARL: Come on, it might work.

163
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,810
VARL: Plus you'll get to see some friendly faces again.

164
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:09,463
ALOY: Okay, I…

165
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,349
ALOY: I guess it's worth a shot.

166
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,768
VARL: We've got a long walk ahead.

167
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,820
ALOY: Actually…

168
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,222
ALOY: I've got a better idea.

169
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,091
BYSTANDER: By the Sun, it's true. She's come back!

170
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:03,250
CARJA NOBLE: Bless us! The Saviour of Meridian has returned!

171
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,853
You earned this welcome.

172
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,304
You saved them.

173
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:09,407
ALOY: Not yet.

174
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,212
MARAD: In the name of the Sun-King Avad,
a royal welcome for the Champion!

175
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,514
MARAD: Make way.

176
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,487
VARL: Marad, Aloy has an urgent matter to discuss.

177
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,190
Does she? That makes two of us.

178
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:29,643
I've sent forth hunters for weeks.

179
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,514
MARAD: To Sunfall, all the way to the Sacred Land, searching for you.

180
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,283
Something happened at the Spire.

181
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,705
MARAD: Come, I'll show you.

182
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,613
MARAD: Watch your step.

183
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,151
MARAD: You saved us all, to be sure,
but we're still cleaning up the mess.

184
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,677
MARAD: It happened right after the solstice.

185
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,430
MARAD: We were able to explain it away, thank the Sun.

186
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,600
Otherwise it might have caused a panic.

187
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,788
One night, for less than half a minute, it glowed an angry red.

188
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,357
From Meridian, it looked like a trick of the light.

189
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:37,478
MARAD: But those who were closer, atop the Alight,
said it could not have been a reflection.

190
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:41,098
MARAD: Much to my dismay, they said the light
rose up from the tower's base.

191
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,983
MARAD: From that!

192
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:45,936
MARAD: We left everything just as it was.

193
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:49,106
VARL: What do you think happened?

194
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,274
ALOY: I don't know.

195
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,346
ALOY: The Spire is supposed to send out
signals — messages — for the terraforming system.

196
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,616
VARL: But Hades tried to use it to wake up ancient war machines.

197
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,068
ALOY: I was sure I cut the connection to that thing.

198
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:03,971
ALOY: Wait here while I check it out.

199
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,292
VARL: Let us know what you find.

200
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,953
ALOY: I've got a bad feeling about this.

201
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,656
ALOY: I don't know, looks the same as before.

202
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:26,827
Never could pull this thing out of the—

203
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,630
What?!

204
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,130
"Transmission"?

205
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,733
No, he wouldn't…

206
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,035
…he couldn't.

207
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,023
Something was transmitted from the top of the spire.

208
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,926
I guess I have to find a way up there.

209
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,343
There we go.

210
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,452
Now, how to cross over to the Spire?

211
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,493
Should be able to get up there now.

212
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,750
I thought Sylens was helping me when he gave me his lance.

213
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,670
Looks like he tricked me.

214
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,173
Transmitted something through the Spire.

215
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:38,192
Did he save Hades?

216
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,378
Why would he do that?

217
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:45,482
If I can figure out where he sent it, I can track him down.

218
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,370
Hopefully the transmission node at the top will tell me.

219
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,189
Looks like this panel's ajar.

220
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,692
Can I go up through the inside?

221
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,603
An elevator? Let's see.

222
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,831
COMPUTER: Access lift activated.

223
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,318
My lucky day.

224
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,021
COMPUTER: Engaging maintenance configuration.

225
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,608
The whole thing is opening up.

226
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,331
Wonder what the Carja will make of this.

227
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:51,231
There's the node.

228
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,588
Somewhere to the far West.

229
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,590
Bastard.

230
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,043
SYLENS: Well, Aloy…

231
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,914
SYLENS: I see you finally figured it out.

232
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:29,036
SYLENS: To be honest, I'm surprised
it took you so long to discover my ruse.

233
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:32,072
You rigged the lance to steal Hades.

234
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:34,491
How could you be so reckless?

235
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,559
SYLENS: Reckless?

236
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:42,516
You're the one who tried to purge Hades
before its precious knowledge could be … extracted.

237
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,186
The mysterious signal that woke it, for example.

238
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,591
SYLENS: Or where to obtain one of those Gaia backups
you've been having such a hard time finding.

239
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,428
ALOY: If you knew why didn't you just tell me?

240
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:58,932
SYLENS: I've been having problems of my own
these past six months, Aloy.

241
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:02,636
SYLENS: The difference is I've made progress.

242
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:07,140
SYLENS: So once your anger
at my entirely necessary deception has faded…

243
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,061
SYLENS: …well, why don't you come out here
and find me in the Forbidden West…

244
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,131
SYLENS: …and learn all that I have discovered.

245
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,917
ALOY: Oh, I'll come find you, alright.

246
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:22,139
SYLENS: Yes, well, the coordinates should make it simple enough…

247
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,725
SYLENS: …even for you.

248
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,764
GAH!

249
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,226
[sighs]

250
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,167
There's no other choice.
