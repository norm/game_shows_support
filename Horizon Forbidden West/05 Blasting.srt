00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,791
VOICE: By. The. Forge!

2
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:26,693
ALOY: Petra?

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,396
PETRA: Aloy! What are you doing here?

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,880
ALOY: Uhh…

5
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:34,067
PETRA: 'Bout time there was something worth looking at in this dump.

6
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,219
ALOY: It's nice to see you too.

7
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,455
PETRA: And not a moment too soon.

8
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,590
ALOY: Uh Petra! Petra!

9
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,676
I'm just passing through.

10
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,662
I'm headed west.

11
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:47,230
Oh.

12
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,234
There's an Embassy at Barren Light I need to make happen.

13
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,354
And then I… keep moving.

14
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:57,857
Ah, of course.

15
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,060
Bigger gears to grind.

16
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,314
Well, flamehair, good to see you.

17
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,783
If you gotta move on…

18
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,685
Petra.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,307
But if you want a cold beer and a few laughs with an old friend?

20
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,693
Come find me at the brewery, your choice.

21
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,966
But if the whole mine becomes unstable?

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,170
I'd rather suffer Ulvund's wrath than die buried in rubble.

23
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,422
I could check in on your crew?

24
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,940
I would appreciate that.

25
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,725
Thank you.

26
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,871
It seems like bitter leaf likes to grow on rocky terrain.

27
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,783
Okay, I think I have enough bitter leaf.

28
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,771
Hold onto this for later.

29
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,920
There, that should be enough wild meat for Milduf.

30
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:09,889
Can't override that machine,
but I could learn if there's a cauldron out here.

31
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,788
Frost'll make it brittle.

32
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:06,041
Huh, hunter becoming the hunted.

33
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,237
Scroungers.

34
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,907
Milduf said I could find a metal panel in one of their scrap piles.

35
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,234
No metal panel, better check another scrap pile.

36
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,828
Acid ammo could help here.

37
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,793
I'll save the extra stock for later.

38
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,907
DELVER: Does your All-Mother hear your prayers out here?

39
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,369
I think I have everything I need for Milduf.

40
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,172
Good thing too, I could use a decent meal.

41
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,909
This metal panel should work for Milduf.

42
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,884
Spotted!

43
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,693
Smoke, coming from where Arnuf said I'd find his crew.

44
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,701
This must be the mine Arnuf told me about.

45
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,320
It looks like the miners are in trouble!

46
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,671
[panting]

47
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,139
KORVEND: You good?

48
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:54,326
VALGEND: I–I'm okay. Thank you, Korvend.

49
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,427
ALOY: Korvend?

50
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,996
KORVEND: Not now. Aah!

51
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,518
ALOY: Arnuf sent me. What happened?

52
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,639
Explosion in the mine.

53
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,626
Water flooded the whole place.

54
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,711
KORVEND: Some of my guys are still…

55
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,948
KORVEND: They're still down there, I can't–can't stop…

56
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,317
You've done enough.

57
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,221
ALOY: Are you hurt?

58
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:24,907
KORVEND: I'm…

59
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,525
KORVEND: I'll live.

60
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:28,677
KORVEND: I can't…

61
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,662
I have to go.

62
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,581
How many are still down there?

63
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,852
KORVEND! How many?

64
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,637
KORVEND: Uhh…

65
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,242
KORVEND: Two, I think. Two more.

66
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,745
Take care of him, I'll check on the others.

67
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,068
Gotta find those two miners, quick.

68
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,187
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

69
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,922
DISTANT VOICE: Over here!

70
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,476
LOKUF: I think I'm starting to see things — is that a Nora?

71
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,478
Are you okay?

72
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:10,762
Who are you?

73
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,965
Korvend sent me. Are you hurt?

74
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,768
LOKUF: My leg.

75
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:20,589
LOKUF: I… I was a little too close to the blast.

76
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,339
ALOY: What happened?

77
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:26,995
THORDEN: We were blasting in the farthest tunnel,
but the scaffolding didn't hold, it collapsed.

78
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,881
THORDEN: I think it blocked the drainage shaft.

79
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,335
THORDEN: Water started flooding the place as quick as I drink ale.

80
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,053
THORDEN: I barely managed to drag us here.

81
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,823
ALOY: So something is keeping the water inside the tunnels.

82
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,157
LORUF: What are you thinking?

83
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,510
ALOY: I've got an idea. Are there more explosives?

84
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,011
Are you crazy?

85
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,764
Yeah, should still be some up top, but…

86
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,849
You'll need these fuses.

87
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,518
Are you crazy?

88
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:52,471
You can't move and I'm not leaving you.

89
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,090
THORDEN: It's not like she can make things worse.

90
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:56,591
ALOY: Don't go anywhere.

91
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,262
I need to find whatever's blocking that drainage shaft.

92
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,180
And blow it sky high.

93
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,767
Hopefully without bringing the mine down on top of me.

94
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,370
Almost there.

95
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,378
Oof, made it.

96
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,867
There's the debris blocking the shaft.

97
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:44,172
If I can reach those explosives up on that track,
maybe I can blast through the blockage.

98
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,769
Burrowers.

99
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,689
I think that's all of them.

100
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,092
Now to find a way out of this room.

101
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,576
I need to find a way up to those explosives.

102
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,118
I should follow those tracks, see if they lead to the explosives.

103
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:49,167
Let's see where this leads.

104
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,957
There's the explosives up on the track.

105
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,676
Just need to get across somehow.

106
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,679
Might be a good idea to drop that ladder.

107
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,667
That did the trick.

108
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,819
Guess that got its attention.

109
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,679
Down it goes!

110
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,687
That's all of them. Now let's go check on those miners.

111
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,590
LOKUF: She's so dead.

112
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,475
THORDEN: We don't know that!

113
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,467
It looks like everyone's okay.

114
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,971
LOKUF: Ha ha ha! I can't believe we're not gonna die!

115
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:48,656
THORDEN: You did it.

116
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,675
LOKUF: I thought you blew yourself up.

117
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,760
Are you two okay from here?

118
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,546
I can get this idiot down, don't you worry.

119
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,681
Thanks, kid.

120
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,478
Better let Korvend know his men are all right.

121
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,651
I found the two you mentioned.

122
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,671
They're safe, but could probably use a hand.

123
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,089
Is that everyone?

124
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,074
It is.

125
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,212
I dread to think what would have happened if you hadn't shown up.

126
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:49,117
I knew we were blasting too much,
but the man who staked the claim here, Ulvund…

127
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:51,919
Grr, he kept pushing and pushing me.

128
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,641
I tried to shield my crew from his constant demands, every damn day.

129
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,112
I … I should have been stronger.

130
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:03,681
You were there for your crew when they needed you.

131
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,550
That counts for something.

132
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,385
Ulvund can threaten me all he wants.

133
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:11,189
I am not letting my people back into those mines.

134
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,690
Will you be all right?

135
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,677
Yes, I can take it from here.

136
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,597
KORVEND: Thank you, huntress. I'll see the last two make it out.

137
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,781
MINER: I knew we were blasting too fast!

138
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:52,964
Now they're mad.

139
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:02,366
I'll leave you here.

140
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,977
GUARD: Be welcome, outlander.

141
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:10,768
There you are! I happened to receive another visit from Ulvund himself.

142
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,203
I'm listening.

143
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:17,859
When I made his meal, I used three pinches of salt!

144
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,963
Instead of two!

145
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:25,216
Each journey begins with a single step, I guess.

146
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,236
ALOY: I think I have everything you asked for.

147
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:32,290
MILDUF: Then, just as you have inspired me,
let us see if I can return the favour.

148
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,658
MILDUF: Time to cook!

149
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:57,665
Wow, Milduf that was inspired!

150
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:01,168
Next time you want the best provisions, you know where to find me.

151
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,889
And your next order of any dish will be on the house.

152
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,743
Thanks. And don't forget to stand up for yourself.

153
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,344
MILDUF: Funny you should say that.

154
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:14,966
MILDUF: As it happens, I'm already cooking up my next portion of resistance.

155
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,667
MILDUF: Hope to see you again.

156
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:40,258
PETRA: Aloy! Change your mind about that brew?

157
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:45,513
PETRA: Come for that beer after all eh? Here! Siddown!

158
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,848
PETRA: Get a pint in her hand!

159
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,234
PETRA: Wasn't expecting you to swing by.

160
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,503
ALOY: Since when do I do what's expected?

161
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,623
PETRA: Hah! There's that spark!

162
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,458
PETRA: Fire and spit!

163
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:03,164
ALOY: Uh, fire and spit.

164
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,736
PETRA: Aaah! That's a blast from the bellows.

165
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:12,740
PETRA: Won't fix the forge, but at least
I can forget about my troubles for a while.

166
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,724
ALOY: Like what?

167
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,159
PETRA: Take your pick.

168
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,728
We got bodies to bury from the Bristlebacks.

169
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,113
The work stoppage.

170
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,450
Ulvund grating the gears about his concession decree.

171
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,953
PETRA: Hey! Weapons off the table!

172
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,562
PETRA: Right now, I'm just worried about those refugees out from Sunfall.

173
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,932
To come all this way, enduring forge knows what.

174
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,950
ALOY: Shadow Carja refugees?

175
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,970
PETRA: They don't call themselves Shadow Carja for one.

176
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,588
PETRA: At least, not any more.

177
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,891
PETRA: They are some other brand of sun-crazed.

178
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,259
ALOY: What are they doing in The Daunt?

179
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,611
PETRA: Um, looking for a new home, I gather.

180
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:53,831
PETRA: They're camped out by an old trail head southwest of here.

181
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,866
PETRA: And therein lies the problem.

182
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,602
PETRA: A Stormbird crashed up on the cliffs last week.

183
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,373
PETRA: And Tolland Cleanbroker's had his eye on the salvage ever since.

184
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,442
PETRA: But the refugees have barred entrance.

185
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,128
PETRA: Mustn't interrupt their sun-scorched ritual.

186
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,363
PETRA: Something about finding a "twilight path".

187
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,416
ALOY: Huh, never heard them talk about that before.

188
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,970
PETRA: Yeah, well, these particular Shadow Carja are an odd bunch.

189
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,724
PETRA: But whatever side of the Sun they're on,
they're peaceful through and through.

190
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,795
PETRA: Don't seem to want for nothing except a place to live, pray,
and just enough food to keep from starving.

191
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:31,352
ALOY: So they're just camped outside by a trail,
blocking entry to a wrecked Stormbird, waiting for what, exactly?

192
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,537
PETRA: Don't rightly know, but I'll tell you this.

193
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,756
PETRA: Should they ever wise up and salvage it?

194
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:38,025
PETRA: A Stormbird heart is worth a lot.

195
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:41,278
PETRA: And if they get there first, then by Oseram law, it's theirs.

196
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,732
PETRA: Overall they're a peaceful folk, not that it matters to Tolland.

197
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:47,818
PETRA: He'll crack some heads to get to that salvage.

198
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,154
Who is this Tolland Cleanbroker?

199
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,507
PETRA: Just some chuff-huffing pondsman, got a shop here in town.

200
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,427
PETRA: Lived in Chainscrape since there was a Chainscrape.

201
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,514
PETRA: He and Ulvund go back a ways,
like a pair of coals in a camp fire those two.

202
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,400
ALOY: So Tolland works for Ulvund?

203
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,885
PETRA: Ha! Ulvund might think so.

204
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:07,972
PETRA: But Tolland scrapes up his own scams.

205
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:13,444
PETRA: And he ain't the type to let a few refugees
get between him and Stormbird salvage.

206
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,464
So the Bristlebacks in The Daunt…

207
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,215
OSERAM: [burps]

208
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,334
PETRA: You're a pig!

209
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,586
ALOY: …where did they come from?

210
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,723
PETRA: That's the thing, no-one rightly knows.

211
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:30,761
PETRA: They just showed up one day,
rampaging around the valley like they exploded out of a forge.

212
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,365
PETRA: [sighs] Lost some good people.

213
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:39,370
PETRA: But bless the bellows, you cleared them out
and got this place working again.

214
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,974
PETRA: But we still got Ulvund grating the gears about his concession decree.

215
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:48,429
PETRA: If you don't put that down,
I'll come over there and show you how that game ends!

216
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,416
PETRA: Around here, everything's about Ulvund.

217
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,851
ALOY: How'd he end up in charge?

218
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,888
PETRA: He got here early like a squirrel smelling a fat nut.

219
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,976
PETRA: He knew rebuilding Barren Light would need stone and timber.

220
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:04,678
PETRA: So he jangled purses all over Mainspring,

221
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:09,500
PETRA: getting investors to front claims on anything
 in The Daunt that might be worth a damn.

222
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,687
PETRA: Thing is, all the bankers back home know that this is Carja land.

223
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:17,374
PETRA: And the Sun-King can revoke those claims at any time.

224
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,512
PETRA: That's why he's desperate for the magistrate
to sign off on a concession decree.

225
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,497
ALOY: And people actually believe him?

226
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:27,568
PETRA: Lots of folks suffered at the hands of
the Mad King during the Red Raids.

227
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,855
PETRA: Give them half a reason they'll blame the Carja for anything.

228
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:34,325
OSERAM: Yeah, damn Carja slavers.

229
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:39,180
ALOY: Well, if I'm up that way, I'll talk to the refugees,
try to convince them to move.

230
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,049
PETRA: Much appreciated, they have it rough.

231
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,351
PETRA: Don't need Tolland making it rougher.

232
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:45,553
ALOY: I'm glad I stopped by.

233
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,254
PETRA: Any time, flamehair.

234
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:53,394
This Tolland guy might still be in Chainscrape.

235
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,880
I could have a word with him first.

236
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,321
VOLMA: 'Bout time that whistle blew.

237
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:25,709
HAKUND: Shop just opened up, and I've got a backlog of orders,
so I wouldn't hold my breath.

238
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,981
HAKUND: Brought out only the good stuff for you, Red,
seeing as you got that whistle blowin'.

239
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,169
VOLMA: Hey, I've been waiting to get my lucky hammer fixed for days!

240
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:39,873
HAKUND: You haven't done anything useful
like getting rid of any Bristlebacks, though, have you?

241
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,377
HAKUND: Take your time, I promise you won't be disappointed.

242
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,141
TOLLAND: Oh it's you, the machine hunter that bailed out the Carja.

243
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,360
ALOY: Never heard it put that way before.

244
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:04,528
What do you want?

245
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,581
Heard you've been hassling refugees up by the cliffs.

246
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,249
TOLLAND: Yeah, well, you heard wrong.

247
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,252
TOLLAND: There's salvage up there, a Stormbird.

248
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:15,239
TOLLAND: Nailed it myself with the harpoon here in town.

249
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,258
TOLLAND: Not an easy shot, if I do say so myself.

250
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:23,564
TOLLAND: I clipped its wing and it crashed
into the old tower up there. Killed it quick.

251
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:30,003
So if anyone's hassling anyone, it's the Shadow Carja filth
that's blocking the way up to my claim.

252
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:32,789
ALOY: And you're ready to crack some skulls to get to it?

253
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:38,929
TOLLAND: No need, it's a raggedy bunch,
probably all starve before I have to lift a finger.

254
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,531
ALOY: We'll see about that.

255
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,449
TOLLAND: Oh, yeah, we will, won't we?

256
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,437
TOLLAND: Now, shop's closed to Carja lovers. On your blasted way.

257
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,058
ODURG: Move those feet!

258
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:02,152
ODURG: The Saviour of Meridian! Come on over here.

259
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,505
ALOY: You wanted to speak to me?

260
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:09,910
ODURG: Well, you know better than anyone it's
a dangerous world out there, and not just against machines.

261
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,330
ODURG: Name's Odurg. This here's my training pit.

262
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,434
ODURG: Best place to practise close combat
this side of the Forbidden West.

263
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,305
ODRUG: Say, I wonder who'd win in a fight?

264
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,575
ODURG: You, the Saviour of Meridian, champion of the East?

265
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:28,862
ODURG: Or The Enduring, master of the West.

266
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:29,847
ALOY: Who?

267
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:35,435
ODURG: The Enduring. A legendary Tenakth fighter, the master of masters.

268
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,739
ODURG: I've heard the Tenakth have training pits just like this one.

269
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,842
ODURG: It's how their warriors get so fierce, see?

270
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:46,046
ODRUG: And only the very best from the pits
get to train with The Enduring.

271
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:51,635
ALOY: So to find The Enduring, I should look for these
training pits if I'm ever out that way?

272
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,520
ODURG: You'll have to go far if you do.

273
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,772
ODURG: The Tenakth are split into three clans.

274
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:59,326
ODURG: Three clans, three capitals, three training pits.

275
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:03,413
ODURG: My guess is you'd have to beat all of them
if you want to train with The Enduring.

276
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,999
ODURG: If the Tenakth don't kill you on sight, that is.

277
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,751
ODURG: But that's a far spark in the wind.

278
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:13,040
ODURG: As for right now, I also offer challenges to test your fighting skill.

279
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:16,059
Who would I be fighting exactly, you?

280
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:21,632
ODURG: Well, I know you're the Saviour and all,
but you have to beat all the others first to challenge me.

281
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,116
ODURG: Rules are rules.

282
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,737
ODURG: We only use dull blades and practise arrows, mind.

283
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,123
ODURG: These drunken fools would run themselves through otherwise.

284
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:33,961
ODURG: You'll have to leave everything
but your spear and practise arrows at the gate.

285
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,047
ODURG: But I'll look after your gear, not to worry.

286
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:41,902
ODURG: So, what do you say? Up for some training? [chuckles]

287
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,103
I might be.

288
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,405
That's what I like to hear.

289
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:30,010
ODURG: If you keep repeating the same attacks,
your enemy will dodge them.

290
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:34,731
ODURG: Vary your attacks and combinations,
make yourself less predictable.

291
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:50,197
ODURG: Come on, if your opponent keeps blocking,
then use a heavy attack or a power attack to break through.

292
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,533
ODRUG: Either that or hit them from beind.

293
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,855
ODURG: Pay close attention to your opponent's stance.

294
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:19,126
ODURG: Read their intentions, choose your attacks to break their defence.

295
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,331
ODURG: You think your spear can deal with that armour?

296
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,167
ODURG: Use attacks to energise your spear.

297
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:48,388
ODURG: Then hit your opponent with a heavy
or power attack to blast their armour off.

298
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,192
ODURG: That spear can give you the edge in battle.

299
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,928
ODURG: Keep energising it, and then your enemies.

300
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:58,415
ODURG: Triggering those energy blasts
should help you vanquish your opponents.

301
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,462
ODURG: Can you finish this?

302
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,452
ODURG: I see how you earned your reputation.

303
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,191
ODURG: A good series of attacks!

304
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:27,077
ODURG: You fight well.

305
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:29,496
ODURG: Impressive attack!

306
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:38,922
ODURG: I see how you earned your reputation.

307
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:45,078
ODURG: Ho ho, good, an impressive attack.

308
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,219
ODURG: You fight well.

309
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:11,571
ODURG: Impressive attack, you fight well.

310
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:13,840
ODURG: Let's test your skills.

311
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:20,881
ODURG: Yield! I yield.

312
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,788
ODURG: Well fought, friend, well fought.

313
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,373
ALOY: Are you okay?

314
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,692
ODURG: [laughing] Yeah. Oof.

315
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:36,646
ODURG: Serves me right for thinking I could go up
against the Saviour of Meridian.

316
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,201
ODURG: Here, have this. A little something for the new champion.

317
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,203
ALOY: Thank you, Odurg.

318
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,488
ODURG: Don't be a stranger, now.
