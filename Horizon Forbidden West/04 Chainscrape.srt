1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:26,443
VUADIS: I shall head to Barren Light when
the captain of the Vanguard tells me the way is clear.

2
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,161
And not a moment sooner.

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,930
Fine.

4
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,650
Captain's a friend of mine, you know.

5
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,920
ALOY: Where is Erend?

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,790
Wouldn't mind speaking to someone a little more action, a little less …

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,158
… scroll.

8
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:46,329
Vuadis sent Erend and another vanguard
out at daybreak to clear the way.

9
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,448
VUADIS: "And so at daybreak—"
ALOY: Hey!

10
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:49,749
ALOY: Shh!

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,018
ALOY: Down the valley, then?

12
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,721
Yeah, said they'd check the ruins on the left bank for tracks.

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,772
Take it from there.

14
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:56,573
Okay.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,842
ALOY: So the Vanguards came through here?

16
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,261
THURLIS: Yeah, just a bit ago.

17
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,847
THURLIS: Downed that Bristleback, headed south.

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:09,152
THURLIS: But then those Scroungers showed up
to carve the carcass, as they do.

19
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,938
THURLIS: Then another Bristleback ran through.

20
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,657
I'm telling you, it's crazy around here.

21
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,726
So the Vanguard went south.

22
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:20,530
Probably. This whole valley is swarming with them.

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,066
THURLIS: The Vanguard seemed dead set on getting rid of them.

24
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,537
ALOY: Thanks

25
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:28,988
TELGA: Stay safe, Aloy.

26
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,914
Sounds like someone's putting up a fight.

27
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,122
ALDUR: Another one down!

28
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,759
EREND: Now this? This is what I was forged for!

29
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,278
EREND: No ledgers to fill.

30
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,215
EREND: No boring mid-afternoon patrols.

31
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,612
Just the hammer. Just the fight!

32
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,733
Aloy?!

33
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,118
Erend!

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,292
ALOY: Stay where you are, I'll handle the rest!

35
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,717
EREND: Dammit, I should be down there.

36
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,685
ALDUR: Not with those ribs.

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,773
ALOY: Those Bristlebacks have acid canisters on their backs.

38
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,809
It should trigger a chain reaction if I hit them with acid arrows.

39
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,646
EREND: Turn 'em to scrap, Aloy!

40
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,588
Machine's weak against Frost.

41
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,983
EREND: Look at that thing fizzing away!

42
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,390
EREND: Smashed 'em good!

43
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,282
EREND: Ha, ha! Oh, that one hurt.

44
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,794
EREND: Unh! Like hammer to metal!

45
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,274
EREND: Ha, ha! Oh, that one hurt.

46
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,416
EREND: Smashed 'em good!

47
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,597
That could help.

48
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:35,271
EREND: Aloy, you know you might have to — OOF —

49
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:39,459
EREND: — meet me half-way here — AAAH!

50
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,964
EREND: Aloy! Uhh, oh that's gonna hurt tomorrow.

51
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,885
EREND: Caught me at my best, as usual.

52
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,456
You did the hard part, I just took care of the stragglers.

53
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:12,775
How bad is it?

54
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,561
Oh this? Ah, who needs ribs, eh?

55
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,429
EREND: Ow!

56
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,581
EREND: Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

57
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,169
EREND: Okay, well, I …

58
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,873
I know you didn't come all the way to The Daunt
just to watch me get wrecked.

59
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,274
What's the story?

60
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,395
I need the Embassy to happen so I can head west.

61
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,982
ALOY: Erend, what I did at the Spire…

62
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,817
ALOY: …what WE did…

63
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,786
…it didn't end the threat.

64
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,172
It just slowed it down.

65
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,893
There's still more to do.

66
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,294
EREND: Really?

67
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,379
Well, that's great!

68
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,517
I mean, not the "threat's not over" part, that's not so great.

69
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:59,005
But hey, whatever you're up against, your spear, my hammer!

70
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,439
Just like old times!

71
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,794
ALOY: Erend, I need the Embassy now.

72
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,063
I can't wait for you to heal.

73
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,731
A couple of days rest, if that.

74
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:14,870
ALOY: Actually, even if you weren't hurt, what I have to do it's …

75
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,490
… it's better if I do it alone.

76
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,793
EREND: Alone.

77
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,280
EREND: Now that figures.

78
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,299
ALDUR: Erend!

79
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,186
ALDUR: I hate to interrupt the romance, but I'm pretty banged up here.

80
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,738
EREND: Don't blow your blaze, I'm coming.

81
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,559
EREND: Ugh, this just keeps getting better.

82
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,681
Listen,

83
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:45,534
I'll go to Barren Light, get patched up.

84
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,589
If you want this Embassy to happen …

85
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,176
… we're going to need this Sun-Priest, Studious Vuadis.

86
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,695
I know him.

87
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,832
I'll clear the valley of Bristlebacks, then send Vuadis to Barren Light.

88
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,284
I'll catch up with you there.

89
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,487
Well, I guess that's sort of like a goodbye.

90
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,873
I'm sorry?

91
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,376
You? Sorry? Hah.

92
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,361
That'd be a first.

93
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,879
ALOY: Where is this coming from?

94
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,032
EREND: Hey, just, you know, forget it, yeah?

95
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:17,984
EREND: It's nothing.

96
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,286
ALOY: It sounds like something.

97
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,772
Alright, fine.

98
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,126
Now, after the battle at the Spire, you took off.

99
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,595
You left without so much as a handshake.

100
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,748
EREND: I mean, people like me, we fought and bled at your side, Aloy.

101
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,884
EREND: You just, what, you just disappear?

102
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,786
EREND: What kind of person does that?

103
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,274
How about someone who thinks saving the world
is more important than whether your feelings get hurt?

104
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,743
Saving the world?

105
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,628
That's what I've been doing, Erend.

106
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,229
ALOY: What I'm still doing.

107
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,799
So, sorry if I've been in a hurry.

108
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,969
Erend, I left when I did, how I did for a reason.

109
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,254
A good one.

110
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,139
Oh, thanks for sharing.

111
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,342
Listen to me.

112
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,796
Life on Earth is in danger and only I can save it.

113
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,431
What're you talking about?

114
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,100
Everything dies unless I succeed.

115
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,302
EREND: Well, then let me help!

116
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,154
ALOY: You can't.

117
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,808
There's no machine to fight, no bad guy to kill.

118
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,343
What I've gotta do, I …

119
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,746
I can't even explain it.

120
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,350
Not even to people I care about.

121
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,319
Yeah, I guess that's a reason alright.

122
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,041
As usual, I shouldn't've said anything.

123
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,245
ALDUR: Erend! By the Forge!

124
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,348
I guess that's my cue.

125
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,001
Maybe I should go with you to Barren Light.

126
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:46,756
No, no, hey, no, you're you needed elsewhere, obviously.

127
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,541
We'll make it without you.

128
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,232
ALOY: That doesn't sound good.

129
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,334
EREND: You'll have to handle that one on your own.

130
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,453
EREND: We'll only slow you down.

131
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,951
What are those Oseram doing out here?

132
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,937
OSERAM: Quick! Gotta scrap 'em before the Scroungers get 'em!

133
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,142
ALOY: That Bristleback's charging right at them!

134
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,061
OSERAM: Haha! Another one for the scrap pile.

135
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,430
OSERAM: Your help was timely, Nora.

136
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,051
ALOY: Just get back to Chainscrape before you get yourselves killed.

137
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,420
OSERAM: Not with all this salvage lying about!

138
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,322
OSERAM: C'mon crew, back to it!

139
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,243
Quarry's full of Bristlebacks.

140
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,495
BELNA: Break those acid chuckers!

141
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,251
ALOY: Getting there.

142
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,435
BELNA: One down!

143
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,970
ALOY: One less machine.

144
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,518
BELNA: Look out! We got a different machine out here.

145
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,789
BELNA: That's it! Smash 'em to scrap!

146
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,241
ALOY: Another one down.

147
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,227
ALOY: This one can spit fire instead of acid.

148
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,280
BELNA: Good hit, now do it again.

149
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,269
ALOY: One less machine.

150
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,704
BELNA: One more down.

151
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,138
ALOY: Another one down!

152
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,896
BELNA: That's it, smash 'em to scrap!

153
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,416
ALOY: There, quarry's safe.

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,119
BELNA: Stranger, come on over here, we gotta talk.

155
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,831
Yeah, Yeah.

156
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,308
BELNA: Come here kid, I wanna talk to you.

157
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,201
I don't know what a Nora is doing out here, but consider yourself owed.

158
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:47,189
We tried to hold off and wait for the Vanguard,
but one of them Bristlebacks charged us.

159
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,492
Next thing you know it was a full-fledged fracas.

160
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:52,211
Is everyone OK?

161
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,496
BELNA: We lost some good people.

162
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,399
But we would have lost the whole quarry without you.

163
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,318
Well, at least it's quiet now.

164
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,304
Your ears ought to be ringing with a quarry at work.

165
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:06,058
But Chainscrape's whistle ain't blowin',
so we're stuck picking up the pieces.

166
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,293
You need the whistle to get back to work?

167
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,196
Me and my crew we're just little cogs out here.

168
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,699
Can't lift a hammer 'til Ulvund blows that thing.

169
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,835
Because if we work without his say so, he'll ban us.

170
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,787
And my people have been through enough.

171
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,989
Ulvund holds that much power?

172
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:25,394
He's got the money and connections to snuff our fires for good.

173
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:28,764
Almost feels like we stood a better chance with the Bristlebacks.

174
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,750
ALOY: What are you and your crew working on?

175
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,769
We're supposed to be working Ulvund's claim.

176
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,988
Digging out stone to shore up Barren Light.

177
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,191
But the work stoppage and the Bristlebacks cut us short.

178
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,394
Never seen those blasted things in The Daunt before.

179
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,764
Where in forgefire did they come from?

180
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,282
I'm not sure.

181
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,867
At least not yet.

182
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,986
I need to get going.

183
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,354
Stay safe.

184
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:55,674
Thanks to you, that might actually be possible today.

185
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,562
Valley should be safe enough to travel.

186
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:03,182
I'll go give Vuadis the good news.

187
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,901
Then maybe this Embassy can finally happen.

188
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,348
Come on!

189
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:37,883
GUARD: Be welcome, Outlander.

190
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,886
Time to get Vuadis to Barren Light.

191
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,453
ALOY: The way to Barren Light is clear, get moving.

192
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:33,588
VUADIS: You're not Erend Vanguardsmen.

193
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:35,323
VUADIS: I will move only when the captain—

194
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:38,810
ALOY: When I've cleared out all the Bristlebacks, which I have.

195
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,428
ALOY: Captain's orders.

196
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,297
JORUF: So they're okay?

197
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:46,485
ALOY: Banged up but breathing, and waiting up ahead for you.

198
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:50,605
VUADIS: Well, I shall not be moving anywhere
until the whistle has sounded.

199
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:54,042
VUADIS: If it is not safe for them, then it is not safe for me.

200
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,477
ALOY: Ugh, fine.

201
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,346
ALOY: I'll make sure the whistle gets blown and then I'll be back.

202
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:02,350
VUADIS: Hear that? We're not leaving yet. Unpack the cart!

203
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,021
ALOY: No, I'll be right back, don't get comfortable.

204
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:08,156
VUADIS: As if that were possible here.

205
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,196
Petra mentioned Ulvund is supposed to be in charge around here.

206
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,781
Guess I should talk to him to get the whistle blown.

207
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:44,576
JAVAD: We are on the same side here, Ulvund.

208
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,229
JAVAD: The Bristlebacks threaten us all.

209
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,064
ULVUND: Oh drop the act.

210
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:52,167
ULVUND: We all know it was the Carja
who let the Bristlebacks into the valley.

211
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,803
ULVUND: Sent them straight through the gates of Barren Light.

212
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,155
JAVAD: That is preposterous.

213
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,226
JAVAD: Why would we let dangerous machines into our own land?

214
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:06,131
ULVUND: You mean the land that honest Oseram labourers
work tirelessly with no say in its governance?

215
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,799
ULVUND: The land that should you sign the decree—

216
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,719
JAVAD: Oh! You and that damned concession decree!

217
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:13,972
ULVUND: —would be managed by the people
who actually live and work on it.

218
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,460
JAVAD: What do you want, Ulvund?

219
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,595
JAVAD: Some kind of payment?

220
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:24,716
ULVUND: My dear magistrate, you think I can be bought?

221
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:29,888
If you want that whistle blown, all you have to do
is have your soldiers remove the Bristlebacks…

222
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,290
ULVUND: …and sign the concession decree.

223
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,611
Face it, what other choice do you have?

224
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:39,514
ALOY: [clears throat] Hi.

225
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,601
JAVAD: Saviour! What auspicious timing!

226
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,621
Might we discuss a matter of importance to the Sundom?

227
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,057
ALOY: We might, later.

228
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:52,277
JAVAD: Very well, I shall be waiting.

229
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:57,966
ULVUND: So the Saviour herself.

230
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,552
Walloper of Dervahl, gutter of Helis.

231
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,004
ALOY: [sighs] Maybe.

232
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:07,842
I've heard many tales of your beauty and heroics, my fierce lady warrior.

233
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:11,830
Ulvund Freeholder, at your service.

234
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:17,385
ULVUND: So what could have dragged you away
from the fine silks and wine of Meridian…

235
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,271
…to this smudge of a settlement?

236
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:24,159
Your Saviourly attention must be needed elsewhere.

237
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,393
I'm here for the Embassy and—

238
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,695
ULVUND: The Embassy?

239
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:29,481
Why, by the Forge.

240
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:32,484
Ah.

241
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,336
Greater gears for greater matters.

242
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,005
Guess that means you'll be moving on.

243
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:42,610
ALOY: Once I've dealt with any problems
around here that need my "Saviourly attention".

244
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,146
ULVUND: Ah, the Bristlebacks, of course.

245
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,584
Got to get rid of them if you want that Embassy to take place.

246
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:54,989
Well, best get to it, hey? And off you go!

247
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,474
ALOY: Not so fast.

248
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,794
You don't seem to have a high opinion of the magistrate.

249
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:05,183
Well, I refuse to play nice to some fancy robed parchment pusher.

250
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:10,271
When my fellow labourers are being bullied,
intimidated, and taken advantage of.

251
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,773
ALOY: How noble of you.

252
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,475
ULVUND: Noble, hah!

253
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,810
ULVUND: Born with a hammer in hand, I was.

254
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,681
ULVUND: Nobody handed me anything
or dropped opportunity into my lap.

255
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,535
Everything I've achieved, I've done on my own.

256
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,687
ALOY: And where is this hammer now?

257
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:30,375
The …uh… burden of leadership forced me to set it aside.

258
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:32,210
ULVUND: The Carja risk nothing.

259
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,531
ULVUND: While demanding that good Oseram
gamble with their lives out there.

260
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:39,484
Someone had to step up and say "no more!"

261
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,686
You ordered the work stoppage?

262
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,254
ULVUND: Indeed I did.

263
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,857
We're labourers, not soldiers.

264
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,394
Until the Carja clean up their mess and give us the fair deal we deserve…

265
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,163
I'm not risking Oseram lives!

266
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,483
"Fair deal"? You mean your concession decree?

267
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:58,570
ULVUND: It's not my decree.

268
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:04,876
ULVUND: It's on behalf of all the good Oseram labourers
of this land who do all the backbreaking work.

269
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,295
While only the Carja reap the rewards.

270
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:11,499
All we're asking for is the ability to share in this prosperity.

271
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,202
For a land worked by the people, for the people!

272
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:14,853
For a land worked by the people, for the people!

273
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,756
ALOY: Right. And just how much would be your share?

274
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:22,911
Only an amount appropriate to my contributions
to this community, of course.

275
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:26,931
If Chainscrape is on Carja land, shouldn't a Carja be in charge?

276
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,533
Who appointed you?

277
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,036
The sensibilities of good Oseram folk, of course.

278
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,323
You think a Carja can head this whole venture?

279
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:36,324
Ha!

280
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:40,595
The Magistrate can barely make the trek
from Barren Light without losing a few screws.

281
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:43,181
So you have no real authority, then?

282
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:47,152
People only follow you because you say so … loudly.

283
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,238
Anyone who has followers has authority.

284
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,441
I've been with Chainscrape from the beginning.

285
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,077
I mean, I'm practically its founder.

286
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,764
And its honest folk know I'm indispensable to its success.

287
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,250
You said you founded Chainscrape.

288
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,952
Somehow I doubt that.

289
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,638
Practically founded, I said.

290
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:12,177
I alone saw its potential when it was just
a smattering of tents in Barren Light's shadow.

291
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,446
ULVUND: I invested in the mine,
convinced some friends back home to do the same.

292
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,948
And here we are.

293
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:20,835
You could say Chainscrape is what it is thanks to me.

294
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,706
Oh, so you're not just standing around and profiting off everyone else?

295
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,057
Not at all.

296
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,511
Sure, I make a little return on my investment here and there.

297
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:37,452
But my main priority, as it was from the beginning,
is to look after the well being of these honest, working Oseram.

298
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,371
I cleared out all the Bristlebacks.

299
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,156
Oh, you did?

300
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:46,010
Now that you've recovered from your shock, time to blow the whistle.

301
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,346
Whoa there, not so fast.

302
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,833
I'll have to send someone out to confirm the kills.

303
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,335
Make sure the valley is safe again.

304
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,372
Shouldn't take more than a day.

305
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:58,740
ULVUND: Or two.

306
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,160
ALOY: No, you blow the whistle now.

307
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,979
These are innocent Oseram lives we're talking about here.

308
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,030
Surely the delay—

309
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,283
ALOY: Either you do it now or I will.

310
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,137
I knew you could do it!

311
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,256
ULVUND: Friends! Gather around.

312
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,743
ULVUND: The Saviour of Meridian has done it again.

313
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,895
ULVUND: The Bristlebacks are defeated.

314
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,164
Uhhh … you.

315
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:23,965
OSERAM: What?

316
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:28,119
ULVUND: Sound the whistle! Chainscrape is open for business.

317
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,987
OSERAM: Terrific.

318
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,687
OSERAM: Great.

319
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,838
OSERAM: Yay.

320
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,745
ALOY: And Ulvund has agreed
to personally pay every worker their lost wages.

321
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:38,813
Yeah!

322
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,747
That's more like it!

323
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,165
Yeah!

324
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,451
Whoo! Haha! Yeah!

325
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,371
[Chainscrape whistle blows]

326
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:49,641
ULVUND: Don't you have an Embassy to get to?

327
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,960
ALOY: Yeah, I guess I do.

328
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,465
Now that Chainscrape's back to work,
merchants should be open to trade.

329
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,804
I should see if they have anything useful
before I send Vuadis off to Barren Light.

330
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,256
Better see what that Carja magistrate wanted.

331
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,359
I bet he's in the tavern.

332
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:06,100
Hey, Milduf. Milduf!

333
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,504
Took some of your stew last time I went into the wild.

334
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,906
Kept me going for a week.

335
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,710
Felt like I could have put a Strider in a sleeper hold.

336
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,879
Enjoy it while it lasts.

337
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:22,483
ALOY: Sounds like you're serving up some impressive provisions here.

338
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,636
MILDUF: Ohh, not again.

339
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,990
MILDUF: You can have the discount too,
but you'll have to come back later.

340
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,726
ALOY: I think you have me confused with someone else.

341
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,095
MILDUF: Ulvund didn't send you?

342
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,413
ALOY: No.

343
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,099
MILDUF: Oh, my apologies.

344
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,502
It's just that his minions won't stop pestering me.

345
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:45,306
Huh, now I've even worn out my special griddle.

346
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:49,243
Since I'm in the midst of a crisis,
perhaps you could skip to what it is you wanted?

347
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,429
ALOY: Some of your food?

348
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,930
Of course.

349
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:56,167
Are Ulvund's people causing you problems?

350
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,654
Oh yeah, they constantly demand my best.

351
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:04,659
But the equipment I need to make
my signature dishes isn't built for batch cooking.

352
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:09,147
And don't get me started on the
"Ulvund discount" they feel so entitled to.

353
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,015
ALOY: And if you refuse?

354
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,267
MILDUF: I make meals, not trouble.

355
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,953
How did you end up in Chainscrape?

356
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,257
Heard about a new and upcoming town at the edge of the frontier.

357
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,343
Where there's a town, there's a tavern.

358
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,861
I was in need of work.

359
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,948
So I got myself out here and started cooking.

360
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:32,070
Some of these people had never tasted proper
boars'n'berries stew before.

361
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,673
Anyway, next thing I knew, people kept coming back.

362
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,143
Guess they like my food … more than ale.

363
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:43,347
Your last customer mentioned your cooking
really kept him going out in the wild.

364
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,650
Where I'm headed I could use some of that.

365
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:50,671
I would be happy to oblige,
especially since you have the decency to ask pleasantly.

366
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,123
ALOY: But…?

367
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,826
But my special grooved griddle is no more.

368
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,312
Without it I can't cook any of my signature dishes.

369
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:03,317
I hate to think what'll happen when
I'm forced to refuse Ulvund or his goons.

370
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:07,772
Even if I already had the right ingredients, there's nothing I could do.

371
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,126
Unless you can source me a temporary replacement?

372
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,795
 What do you need?

373
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:17,431
For the ingredients? A few pieces of decent wild meat.

374
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:21,819
And, let's see, a big handful of bitter leaf stems, that'll do.

375
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,124
As for the griddle, a corrugated metal panel might suffice.

376
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,009
Until I can have a new one forged.

377
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:32,130
You'd likely find one in a Scrounger pile,
if you follow the river to the north-east.

378
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,365
Don't worry, I'll clean it first.

379
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,535
You'll have no issue finding boars and bitter leaf on your way.

380
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,038
Assuming you're as much a hunter-gatherer as your clothing suggests.

381
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,724
Thanks, Milduf. I'll keep an eye out.

382
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,477
MILDUF: So that's what gratitude sounds like.

383
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,847
ALOY: And don't let anyone push you around, okay?

384
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:51,866
If you say so.

385
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:19,093
Saviour, thank you for taking the time.

386
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:23,030
My condolences that you had to endure Ulvund's bloviating.

387
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,016
ALOY: I've dealt with worse.

388
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:27,802
It sounds like he's really trying to put you over the barrel.

389
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:33,357
JAVAD: The idea that the Carja
purposely let Bristlebacks into The Daunt, it's…

390
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,726
It's completely absurd.

391
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:41,415
But the louder and longer he says it,
the more support he'll get for his damned concession decree.

392
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:44,318
How did the Bristlebacks get into The Daunt?

393
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,304
No-one knows for sure.

394
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:51,275
The first report of them came from west of the quarry.

395
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:59,634
According to one terrified labourer,
said the ground trembled before they came charging down the hillside.

396
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,887
He took off and ran all the way here.

397
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,875
But unless they have wings I don't know about,
I don't see how they could have come over the mountains.

398
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,093
ALOY: No other way in?

399
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,963
JAVAD: The only way I know about is Barren Light.

400
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:18,603
If you can get to the bottom of this,
I can offer a considerable bounty in return.

401
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,073
Help me shut Ulvund up!

402
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:28,162
If you learn the truth, maybe Ulvund will stop
blaming the Carja for every problem under the Sun.

403
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:33,534
And maybe then he'll actually focus on rebuilding Barren Light instead.

404
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,988
What is this concession decree that Ulvund wants?

405
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:43,327
He wants the Sundom to designate
portions of The Daunt as Oseram holdings.

406
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,464
Only the portions, mind you, that produce any value.

407
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,734
Let me guess: because he stands to profit somehow?

408
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,269
Exactly.

409
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:57,358
With The Daunt under Oseram law,
he could secure more investment for their numerous ventures.

410
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,794
He can't get those investments without the concession?

411
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:03,998
JAVAD: No, not while there's a chance
the Sundom could revoke their access.

412
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:07,852
JAVAD: Hence why the concession is so important to him.

413
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:16,077
And why blaming the Carja for the Bristlebacks,
no matter how absurd, works in his favour.

414
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:20,298
How does blaming the Carja for the Bristlebacks
help Ulvund get his concession?

415
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,782
Look around.

416
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:30,941
This may be the Sundom, but Chainscrape is
all gears and rust and … bad ale.

417
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:38,132
Claiming that the Carja loosed the Bristlebacks in order
to intimidate Oseram labourers into obedience…

418
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:46,173
Well, let's just say no-one here has forgotten
the atrocities of the Mad Sun-King.

419
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:53,331
Even with the valley working again, Ulvund hopes
he can stir up enough resentment against the Carja to call for a strike.

420
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:58,252
And if the Oseram refuse to work unless
the concession is signed, you won't have a choice.

421
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,553
Correct.

422
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:04,158
The reconstruction of Barren Light must continue.

423
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:07,061
How did you get stuck out here?

424
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,131
I asked for the posting, believe it or not.

425
00:39:11,232 --> 00:39:15,536
Overseeing the entire valley on behalf of the Sun-King?!

426
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,939
It was an honour … is an honour, I mean.

427
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,878
But your job would be a lot easier without
someone like Ulvund blasting hot air all the time?

428
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,247
Ulvund's not going anywhere.

429
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,549
He's been around longer than I have.

430
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,852
Even fancies himself the "Founder of Chainscrape".

431
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:39,143
No, I'll find a way to live with him.

432
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,529
I have to.

433
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,808
ALOY: You heard the whistle, time to go.

434
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:22,029
VUADIS: But I–I was supposed to have three escorts.

435
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:25,583
JORUF: I'm off to Barren Light, Vuadis.

436
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,802
Like Aloy said, Captain's orders. You can stay here.

437
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:31,555
Abandoned to the riff-raff? I think not!

438
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,426
JORUF: Guess you're coming with me then. See you there, Aloy!

439
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:04,738
Well, now that that's done, the Embassy can finally get underway.

440
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:14,532
If I can get through it, I'll be able to
track down Sylens, Hades, maybe even a Gaia backup.

441
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:20,221
Guess I could head straight for Barren Light,
or a poke around The Daunt some more first.

442
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,640
And maybe take Petra up on that drink.

443
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,727
What happened to you?

444
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,429
ARNUF: That damn mine is what happened to me.

445
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,302
It won't be the last injury if Ulvund keeps
shoving his tongs into those tunnels.

446
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:09,403
What mine?

447
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,523
Northeast of Chainscrape, where the river ends.

448
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:17,011
I told Korvend we should stop when the first cave-in happened, but…

449
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,099
…Ulvund probably threatened to cut off our pay. Or worse.

450
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,636
ALOY: How about you slow down and take me through it?

451
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:32,059
Korvend and the others were opening a new vein,
while I was checking on an older one.

452
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:36,614
Soon as their blast hit, tunnel I was in collapsed.

453
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,034
Might have dodged it if I wasn't running on barely a spark of sleep.

454
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,987
We're pushing too hard and too fast.

455
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:46,974
And you're afraid Korvend and the others
might not be as lucky if it happens again.

456
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,044
Mmm-hmm, hit the nail right on the head.

457
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,633
How come Ulvund's in charge? Don't these mines belong to the Carja?

458
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,368
Try telling Ulvund that!

459
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,655
He brought in all the backing to get 'em open, might as well own them.

460
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:08,362
He he, fire and spit, you ask him … he owns us as well.

461
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,247
Who's Korvend?

462
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:13,100
He's the foreman and a damn good one.

463
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,320
The kind of knows how to deal with management
when it gets unreasonable.

464
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,141
But Ulvund? Huh. His demands go beyond unreasonable.

465
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,727
Korvend's been doing his best to appease him.

466
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:28,832
He even blamed himself for my injury,
when it was Ulvund who ordered the extra shifts.

467
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,417
Sounds like a good guy.

468
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,954
That's why we all put up with the long hours and lousy conditions.

469
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,440
But if the whole mine becomes unstable?

470
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:40,644
I'd rather suffer Ulvund's wrath than die buried in rubble.

471
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,896
I could check in on your crew?

472
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,415
I would appreciate that.

473
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,200
Thank you.
