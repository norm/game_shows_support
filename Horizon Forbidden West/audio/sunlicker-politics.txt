These Sunlickers and their scorched-out "diplomacy"! Let's not fuss around the forge: it's a pretty word the Carja use for "not stepping on Tennarckff toes." Which they shouldn't - they have every reason to be afraid of those brutes. But I'm not Carja! I didn't try and invade the West over and over again, just because I felt like it! I have no use for these "Embassies" - another polite term for waving the white flag and saying "please don't kill us."

And now I'm stuck on this side of the wall too, because the Carja couldn't keep it in their sheath! Yeah, sure, "things are different now." "Sun-King Avad believes in peaceful dialogue." Woop-di-doo for you, but simple delvers, traders, and tinkerers like me are sitting on our hands until the priests and Marshals finish their little tea party or whatever it is they do out there. Not to mention our brothers and sisters on the other side of the wall! How are they supposed to get help and supplies when the gate is shut tight?

How much longer do we have to cool our heels? I heard they're waiting on some Sun Priest to arrive, but weren't those nitwits the root of the problem to begin with? They riled up the Mad Sun-King to start the western invasion in the first place!

Writing this was supposed to calm me down, but it's only blown up the bellows! The longer that gate stays closed, the more shards I lose! I've had it! I'm heading over to Barren Light. Someone's going to get a blast of hot air! For all the good it'll do.
