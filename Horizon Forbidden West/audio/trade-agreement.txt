High Council Executive Summary

Negotiations with representatives from Zero Dawn have concluded, and I am exceptionally pleased that we've arrived at a mutually profitable agreement. It shows that sugar usually goes down better than salt, in contrast to the less tactful recommendations of certain of our more reactionary members.

In short, Far Zenith will provide:

A copy of the prototype HOMER archive (already sent).

500 ectogenic chambers (to be retrieved from storage at our Neennmah facility).

Supplementary ectogenesis research reports.

In exchange, Far Zenith will receive a copy of the alpha build of the APOLLO database in the week prior to the Odyssey's launch. By our estimates of Zero Dawn's timeline, by then it should be a near-complete repository of human knowledge.

It should be noted that Dr. Sobeck was very reluctant to agree to this, but I drew a line in the sand, making it clear that this was a non-negotiable term.

As our faithful media representative, I will continue to run all public communications with Dr. Sobeck's team, while <prosody volume='x-soft' rate='x-slow' pitch='x-low'>data corrupted</prosody>
