Delivered in full as spit-sworn by Ragurg Tradesman

Getting harder to deliver your shipments quietly Ulvund. Ran into a Carja patrol and wasted an hour heading to the northern mine just to throw them off the scent.

Javad may be a chuff, but until you get that concession signed he can still shut down my trade. So if you want to keep blasting away at this scorched-out mine, I'm happy to oblige. But my fees have just gone up.
