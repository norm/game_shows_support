By MANDATE of COMMANDER NOZAR, ALL RESIDENTS of the Daunt are herewith informed of the following:

The GATES between Barren Light and No Man's Land are hereby ordered SHUT AND SEALED in expectation of the imminent EMBASSY.

NONE ARE ALLOWED PASSAGE either way UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

NO EXCEPTIONS will be made, regardless of clan house or tribe.

Based on previous grievances and misunderstandings, let it be clear that no exceptions will be made for THE OSERAM either.

Any outstanding arrangements made pertaining to passage are hereby declared POSTPONED or VOID, depending on the nature and timing of the arrangement. NO EXCEPTIONS will be made.

Again, to eliminate any doubts should they remain: ALL OF THE ABOVE PERTAINS TO THE OSERAM REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, EXCUSES, OR SO-CALLED BINDING CONTRACTS!

Any complaints and/or restitutions (if at all applicable) can be addressed to CAPTAIN LAWAN, my second-in-command.

Signed in the Light of the Sun,

NOZAR ARIN KHUVAMAN, COMMANDER OF BARREN LIGHT
