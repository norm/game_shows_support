When I read that Eetamen's Shadow had been captured, I asked myself: Where was his honor? Did he sacrifice himself in battle? Did he give his blood in shame? No. He let himself be taken alive.

On top of that, the Sun-King took mercy on him - the very same traitor who kidnapped his half-brother during the Liberation of Meridian! From Avad's pronouncement: "The rift between Ryas, known as Eetamen's Shadow, and his brother Urid, the Arrow of the Sun, is the same wound that afflicts all families cleft by the civil war. And such injuries must be healed if the Sundom is to move forward." So Ryas lives on, albeit locked in a cell in Sunstone Rock for the rest of his days.

Avad is a good man, but far too kind. I cannot prove Blameless Marad's part in this, but he must be involved. The stay of execution reeks of politics, a bone thrown to noble families with ties to the old regime. Just the kind of craven gesture the spymaster would propose.

Now, as shadows pass with the dawn, I can only hope that Ryas is forgotten forever. His treachery should earn him nothing. Let him rot in the dark.
