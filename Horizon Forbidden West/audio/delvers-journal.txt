Day 1

We descended into the valley and breached the ruins. Boss always had a good sense for delve sites, and by the forge was he right - this place is untouched! Had to knock down a few machines while we were moving our gear - pesky things keep popping out of the ground - but otherwise we've got the whole place to ourselves.

Set up camp near the main entrance. Faruf nearly jumped out of his skin when he dropped his hammer and it went a'clangin' down the stairs. Kid's first delve I reckon, even if he swears otherwise. He's lucky this one's above ground at least.

Day 2

Pushed further into the ruins. Boss tested out his latest prototype, what he's calling a "Hook and Pull." Name needs work if you ask me. I showed Faruf a simple trick to evaluate salvage - the less it's rusted, the higher a price it'll fetch in Meridian.

All in all a good day, until he insisted he saw the trees shakin' across the river. Kid's jumpier than a frog on hot coals.

Day 4

Felt a deep rumble in the dead of night. Landshake maybe, but it's got the whole crew on edge. Boss ordered half of us to set up a second camp further in - figures we'll pick this place clean faster if we split up. No arguments there. Think I'll set up a training dummy for Faruf. Kid can barely hold his own against a Burrower.

Day 6

Only a few of us left. Kid didn't make it. Machine blasted him with acid at the river crossing.

Can hear it slithering outside. Few more minutes rest, then we're going to make a run for-
