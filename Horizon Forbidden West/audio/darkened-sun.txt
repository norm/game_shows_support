We are the Eclipse, elite of the Shadow Carja.

We did as HADES, the Buried Shadow commanded. We followed the prophecy that High Priest Bahavas foretold. We wore the relics of the Old Ones, allowing us to share whispers across the Sundom. We raised an army of ancient machines to lay siege to the traitors who had stolen our holy city of Meridian.

All for naught. The accursed Nora huntress slew our leaders and brought the Buried Shadow low.

What are the faithful to do when prophecy fails them?

But perhaps it has not. Bahavas spoke of a cosmic cycle cut short by the murder of the true Sun-King Jiran. The world, cast in shadow, the wheel of time broken. An unending day under a darkened sun.

What if this period of prophecy is not yet complete? What if the Buried Shadow was not a deliverer, but only a harbinger?

If this is true, our mission hasn't ended. It has barely begun. And it could very well be that the west, land of the setting sun, is where true power lies.
