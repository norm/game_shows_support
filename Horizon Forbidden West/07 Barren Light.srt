1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,091
ALOY: I will find Erend and I will help clear a path.

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,411
But after that, no more excuses.

3
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,197
Barren Light. Embassy.

4
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,502
VUADIS: If such be the will of the Sun.

5
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,322
It will be, trust me.

6
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,175
ALOY: You heard the whistle, time to go.

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,396
VUADIS: But I–I was supposed to have three escorts.

8
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,949
JORUF: I'm off to Barren Light, Vuadis.

9
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,169
Like Aloy said, Captain's orders. You can stay here.

10
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,922
Abandoned to the riff-raff? I think not!

11
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,793
JORUF: Guess you're coming with me then. See you there, Aloy!

12
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,607
DELAH: I know that look.

13
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,726
You've got all the parts, haven't you?

14
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,611
Here you go.

15
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,914
Outstanding!

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,700
I only need a few minutes to finish the prototype.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,970
ALOY: I'll take the version that won't blow my arms off, thanks.

18
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,827
Hi.

19
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,080
So, did you blow up any machines to get the parts?

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,181
Or any bandits?

21
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,217
ALOY: You really like explosions, huh?

22
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,419
DELAH: Here we go.

23
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:44,487
BOOMER: With the boomsticks?

24
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,905
DELAH: Oh, you betcha.

25
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,908
ALOY: Um, is it safe?

26
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,226
DELAH: Probably.

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,361
BOOMER: Can I have one?

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,328
DELAH: No!

29
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:54,080
BOOMER: Aww.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,933
DELAH: 'Cause we're going to make you something even better.

31
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,303
BOOMER: Ba-boom!

32
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,178
JAVAD: Saviour. What news do you bring?

33
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,998
Picked up the Bristleback trail by the quarry.

34
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,301
Looks like they stampeded out of the mine at the back of the valley.

35
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,619
The mine?

36
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,939
How could a herd of Bristlebacks come from there?

37
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,490
ALOY: I'm not sure.

38
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,328
ALOY: But Ulvund's workers were using
explosives to tap the tunnels inside.

39
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:03,099
JAVAD: For the love of Dawn, I told him it wasn't worth the risk.

40
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,121
Those tunnels, they run for miles underground,
even beyond The Daunt.

41
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,823
No, You don't think…

42
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,793
That Ulvund's blasting opened up a passage from the other side?

43
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,830
Perhaps. Yes, perhaps!

44
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,418
If this is true, we need confirmation.

45
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:28,091
An inquiry so thorough, so irrefutable, endorsed by the Saviour.

46
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,210
ALOY: Alright, I'll keep looking.

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,828
Sun light your path.

48
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,498
THURLIS: Come on, you can use that Tripcaster I gave you here.

49
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,250
THURLIS: I'll take care of this.

50
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,434
Thurlis.

51
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,204
So you decided to visit the hunting grounds.

52
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
Good on you.

53
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,991
Isvad here has all kinds of trials.

54
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:19,195
So hotshots like you can put their machine hunting skills to the test.

55
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,398
THURLIS: Or is th Tenakth call it, earning your stripes.

56
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,517
ALOY: I thought hunting grounds were Carja?

57
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,103
THURLIS: The Tenakth have them out west too.

58
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:30,807
THURLIS: Though if you ask the Carja,
Westerners stole the idea from the Sundom.

59
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,845
THURLIS: In fact, the Tenakth used this place for a while
after they kicked the Carja out of the region.

60
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:40,316
THURLIS: They even left behind some of the
special coins they handed out, to those who earned stripes.

61
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:45,204
Look, they're medals, Carja ones, more spoils.

62
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,908
I heard you can trade them for gear,
somewhere in the Tenakth clan lands.

63
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,376
Pretty gruesome, I know.

64
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,796
Then again, so were the Carja during the Red Raids.

65
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,835
THURLIS: Come to think of it, if you plan on going west,
I could convince Isvad to give you some.

66
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,720
THURLIS: If you earn stripes here.

67
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,106
THURLIS: Seems like they might be of use to you out there.

68
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,107
Thanks.

69
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:07,126
THURLIS: If you need anything for the trials, come see me.

70
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,612
THURLIS: I have some wares I'm sure you'd find handy.

71
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,014
THURLIS: You need the right gear if you're going hunting.

72
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,626
THURLIS: Take care, Red.

73
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,820
ISVAD: If you're looking for medals prized by Tenakth,
you can earn them here Saviour.

74
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:37,723
ISVAD: Oh, and I'd like you to have this, if you'd care to use it.

75
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,511
ISVAD: Consider it my thanks for getting Thurlis out of trouble.

76
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,472
ISVAD: Go down the ropes and I'll start timing you.

77
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,211
ISVAD: Everything's set up, just use the ropes to jump in.

78
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,765
ISVAD: This is yours, Saviour.

79
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,052
ISVAD: Grounds are all yours, just use the ropes to jump in.

80
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,391
ISVAD: A lot's changing in the world.

81
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,495
ISVAD: My duty is to these grounds.

82
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,184
ISVAD: This is yours, Saviour.

83
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,336
ISVAD: Until you return, Saviour.

84
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,865
Barren Light.

85
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,885
The last part of the Sundom before the Forbidden West.

86
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,564
[loud horn blares]

87
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:43,475
A Carja horn. Maybe that means the Embassy is starting soon.

88
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,797
Alright, I should find whoever is in charge here.

89
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,734
First, I could resupply at my stash.

90
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,769
Might be worth taking a look around too.

91
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,775
COOK: Friend from the Nora, come and buy!

92
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,523
Take it, enjoy it.

93
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,771
HERBALIST: Balms and herbs, here for sale.

94
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,036
STITCHER: Carja armour, to protect and to flatter.

95
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:29,962
There's Erend. It looks like he's had a few.

96
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,581
CONOVER: Saviour, I need your help!

97
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,467
CONOVER: SAVIOUR!

98
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,169
CONOVER: SAVIOUR!

99
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,536
CONOVER: I beg you, Saviour, listen to me.

100
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,739
CONOVER: Saviour, you're my last hope.

101
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,426
YBRIL: Conover, she's Meridian's Saviour, not yours.

102
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,378
It's just Aloy.

103
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,247
What do you want?

104
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,299
Please, no-one will listen.

105
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,638
But the Eclipse, they're here in The Daunt.

106
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,474
Really, Conover? Aloy is the one that defeated them.

107
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,376
You're bothering her with this hogwash now?

108
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,362
CONOVER: Some of them must have fled west
after the battle at the Alight.

109
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,866
I saw one of our sentries, Laruvik, sneaking off to meet with one.

110
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,469
CONOVER: I tried to eavesdrop, but they spotted me.

111
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,588
CONOVER: And then Laruvik tried to kill me.

112
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,672
I …

113
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,276
… fought back.

114
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,345
It was him or me.

115
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:40,882
YBRIL: Unfortunately, there's no hard evidence
that connects Laruvik to the Eclipse.

116
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:45,437
YBRIL: And since Conover doesn't deny killing his fellow soldier,
Nozar sentenced him to death.

117
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,623
ALOY: What makes you so sure Laruvik was working with the Eclipse?

118
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:54,162
I was too far to hear everything,
but I heard them both say the word "eclipse".

119
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:57,666
YBRIL: It's not the most outlandish claim I've heard, but it's up there.

120
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,902
ALOY: Crying Eclipse is a convenient way to dodge a death sentence.

121
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,971
CONOVER: If I have to die, so be it.

122
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,075
But if we ignore this threat, others are going to die too.

123
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,144
ALOY: Tell me exactly what happened.

124
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:13,565
Weeks ago, during a shift change,
some trespassers slipped through the gate.

125
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,418
By the time anyone noticed they were halfway out the canyon.

126
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,937
Nozar didn't see the need to give chase.

127
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,223
"Let the Tenakth take care of them," he said.

128
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,158
YBRIL: Nozar's not one to be sidetracked.

129
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:27,679
He tightened up the patrol schedules,
reprimanded the sentries, and everyone moved on.

130
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:33,368
None of us are careless out here,
meaning someone left it open on purpose.

131
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,305
And Laruvik, well, he's always grumbling about officers.

132
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:40,175
But on this? He was too quiet.

133
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:44,363
He started acting different, jumpy.

134
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:50,052
So when I spotted him sneaking out
of the barracks after hours, I followed.

135
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,137
I found him arguing with a stranger.

136
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:57,776
And when Laruvik mentioned the Eclipse, I tried getting closer,
but they hurt me.

137
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:03,065
The stranger took off and Laruvik lunged at me with his knife.

138
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,566
Instincts took over.

139
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,372
Sentries heard the scuffle and found me standing over his body.

140
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,157
ALOY: Why don't you believe him?

141
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:17,462
YBRIL: We combed the woods, searched Laruvik's bunk,
searched it again, didn't find anything.

142
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:21,149
YBRIL: Look, Conover is a good man.

143
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,952
I don't believe he murdered Laruvik in cold blood.

144
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:26,221
YBRIL: But Nozar only listens to facts.

145
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,574
YBRIL: And that fact is Conover killed his fellow sentry.

146
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,943
YBRIL: He doesn't deny it, right?

147
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,096
CONOVOER: No, but more Eclipse are out there—

148
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:37,048
YBRIL: And considering there's no evidence
backing up this Eclipse story.

149
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,768
YBRIL: Well, we can't question a dead man.

150
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,923
YBRIL: Nozar's on edge with the upcoming Embassy,
and doesn't want distractions.

151
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,712
If you find a bunch of Eclipse soldiers hatching an evil plot
in the woods, please do let us know.

152
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,714
ALOY: The meeting you witnessed.

153
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,433
Did you hear anything else about their plans?

154
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:59,688
CONOVER: No. But the clearing where they met
is just east of here, across the river.

155
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,475
YBRIL: A dozen soldiers have already
searched it, Conover, there's nothing there.

156
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,976
ALOY: I can see things others can't.

157
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,144
ALOY: I can see things others can't.

158
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,380
YBRIL: It's a lost cause, Saviour.

159
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,581
We'll see.

160
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,552
CONOVER: Thank you, Aloy. Sun bless your search.

161
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,720
YBRIL: Don't get your hopes up, soldier.

162
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:31,296
This must be the clearing where Conover says he saw the eclipse.

163
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,864
Blood stains.

164
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,367
As a good place to start as any.

165
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:43,074
Pretty sure this is where Conover killed that guard.

166
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,762
Maybe my Focus can tell me if there really was a third person here.

167
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,965
I see plenty of tracks from the Carja search party, not helpful.

168
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,081
Broken branches.

169
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,467
Was someone up here?

170
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:40,265
Faint tracks.

171
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,884
Leading away from Barren Light.

172
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:46,171
I should be able to follow them with my Focus.

173
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,376
Let's see where this leads.

174
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,579
Maybe Conover wasn't lying after all.

175
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,876
Lost the trail, there's too many machines walking around.

176
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,463
Maybe I can pick up the tracks once I'm past them.

177
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,756
Uh-oh, I've been spotted.

178
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,962
Should be easy to follow the trail up ahead now.

179
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,414
Blood, a lot of it.

180
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,543
Whoever the runner was, this machine must have slashed him.

181
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,932
Should be easy to follow the blood trail with my Focus.

182
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,857
Looks like they're headed for that bridge.

183
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,144
Bandages. Looks like the runner tried
to treat their wounds before they went on.

184
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,714
Should be able to follow their tracks.

185
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:43,641
Where did you go off to?

186
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:30,438
The trail ends here, must have climbed up to that cave.

187
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:33,141
With that injury I'll bet he's on his last legs.

188
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,150
I'll save this for a dyer.

189
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,846
This looks like a good place for someone to hide.

190
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,364
ECLIPSE: He's dead! What're we supposed to do now?

191
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,250
ECLIPSE: We stay on track and make our way out west.

192
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:02,824
ECLIPSE: If we give up now, the usurper wins.
We have to find Vezreh.

193
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:06,194
ECLIPSE: In his shadow we will find strength.

194
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,480
ECLIPSE: I say we kill the lot.

195
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,683
ECLIPSE: Take on a whole garrison? Won't be easy.

196
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,822
ECLIPSE: We don't know Laruvik's dead.

197
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,124
ECLIPSE: He hasn't shown at the rendezvous point.

198
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,511
ECLIPSE: So either that fool guard killed him or he's lost his nerve.

199
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,663
ECLIPSE: We'll just have to blast our way through the gates.

200
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:31,335
ECLIPSE: And then what? Rayad was our only link to Vezreh.
And now he's dead too.

201
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,021
LIEUTENANT: We'll track Vezreh if we have to.

202
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,591
LIEUTENANT: But first we have to get past Barren Light.

203
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:39,310
LIEUTENANT: Next change of guard we go in fast and loud.

204
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,930
ALOY: Conover was right.

205
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,967
ALOY: I have to stop them before they hurt anyone else.

206
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,861
ECLIPSE: What if Laruvik talked and they know we're coming?

207
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,263
ECLIPSE: What if I stick this knife down your throat?

208
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,332
ECLIPSE: Save it for the heretics.

209
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,400
ECLIPSE: If only we'd caught up with Vezreh earlier.

210
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,419
ECLIPSE: No use crying about it now.

211
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,899
ECLIPSE: Soon we will march on the east, and all will fall.

212
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,305
ECLIPSE: You really think Vezreh has found
a new place for us out west?

213
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,375
ECLIPSE: He knows what he's doing, I'm sure of it.

214
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:58,122
ECLIPSE: I am the shadow and the darkn—.

215
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:51,576
ECLIPSE: The west is a deadly land. A fine place to forge our destiny.

216
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:17,068
ECLIPSE: Vezreh will lead us to glory. And revenge.

217
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:08,469
ECLIPSE: A new empire will rise and I will be one of his leaders.

218
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,403
That takes care of that.

219
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,789
It sounds like there's more eclipse beyond The Daunt.

220
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:33,861
If this Rayad was their only link to them, he might have a Focus.

221
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,713
It could tell me where they are.

222
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,719
I'm guessing that's Rayad.

223
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,604
Blood trail must've been his.

224
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,107
He bled out trying to get here.

225
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,431
I was right, Rayad has a Focus.

226
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,959
VEZREH: Loyal Eclipse.

227
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,017
VEZREH: If you're seeing this, it means
you've left the Sundom in search of something to follow.

228
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,104
VEZREH: Your journey is almost over.

229
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:21,008
VEZREH: Follow the Sun beyond the gates of Barren Light.

230
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,312
VEZREH: And bask in the glow of future conquest.

231
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,216
VEZREH: A new empire awaits!

232
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,336
There's co-ordinates here.

233
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:37,808
I'll have to pay this Vezreh a visit,
and crush his new Eclipse empire before it begins.

234
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:43,998
Rayad's mask should be enough to prove Conover's innocence.

235
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:46,000
I'd better take it back to Barren Light.

236
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,500
When we fought the Eclipse back in Meridian,
I thought that'd be the end of it.

237
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,303
Guess I was wrong.

238
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,698
KERUF: Saviour! Excuse me!

239
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:25,559
Ah Saviour! Tell me, are you seeking passage
into No Man's Land by any chance?

240
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,479
Maybe. Why do you ask?

241
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:33,100
Ah well, to hammer it plain there's treasure out west.

242
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,886
Unclaimed scrap and ancient metal.

243
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,291
KERUF: And I've got a sturdy band of salvagers
that knows the lay of the land.

244
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,110
You're not afraid of the Tenakth?

245
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,648
Heh, terrified! But I carry out most of my business in No Man's Land.

246
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,917
Neutral territory and all that.

247
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,436
KERUF: Barren Light is our port of entry…

248
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,773
…when its doors aren't closed for an Embassy.

249
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:00,044
I was hoping your arrival meant they might be opening soon?

250
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,846
I've got a business to run after all.

251
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,532
I want that Embassy to happen as much as you do.

252
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:08,102
Believe me, I'm working on it.

253
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,791
Good to know … and keep us in mind.

254
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:19,363
If you do manage to open the way,
our main camp will be just past Barren Light.

255
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,116
We'll buy any scrap you've got on you.

256
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:27,354
And if you're looking for machine parts,
we've got the best in the west guaranteed.

257
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,257
Alright, maybe later then.

258
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:33,944
If you can get those blasted gates open!

259
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:41,285
Guess I'm not the only one who wants to get those gates open.

260
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,559
YBRIL: Look alive, soldier. She's back.

261
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,860
Did you find anything?

262
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,464
Eclipse fugitives were camped out on the other side of the forest.

263
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:13,183
ALOY: And they were getting ready
to fight their way through Barren Light.

264
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,519
You just helped save a lot of lives.

265
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,740
Aloy, you know I believe you, but Nozar?

266
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,092
He might not be convinced by your words alone.

267
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,179
If he needs proof, show him that.

268
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:31,802
ALOY: And tell him the man he's got locked up
risked his life to expose and eliminate an Eclipse spy.

269
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,672
Huh, I guess you are his saviour.

270
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,391
YBRIL: Congratulations, soldier, you're a free man.

271
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:39,693
I'll have you out of there before sunfall.

272
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,879
I'll make sure this gets to Nozar.

273
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:45,199
That's it then. The end of the Eclipse.

274
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:47,084
Almost.

275
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:52,373
The tresspassers you mentioned?
The ones who got through Barren Light weeks ago?

276
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,041
ALOY: Their leader is dangerous.

277
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,779
ALOY: And he's out there in the Forbidden West building up an army.

278
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,749
CONOVER: Sun in shadow, you're going
out there to stop them, aren't you?

279
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:02,983
I'm gonna try.

280
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,753
CONOVER: I want to help. I can fight!

281
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:09,490
ALOY: I know you can, but you've been through a lot.

282
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:13,577
Once you're out of that cell you should enjoy your freedom.

283
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:15,195
You've earned it.

284
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:17,181
CONOVER: Take them out, Saviour.

285
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,551
ALDUR: That'll just give me more suffering come morning.

286
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,155
ALDUR: I can barely limp.

287
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:45,075
EREND: You keep saying things,
but all I'm hearing is a lack of determination.

288
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,565
Gentlemen.

289
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,785
ALDUR: That's our cue.

290
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,573
ALOY: Taking the edge off?

291
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:01,575
EREND: Well, if the end of the world is coming.

292
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,360
I don't want to be sober for it.
