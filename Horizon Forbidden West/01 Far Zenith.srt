1
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:05,965
I'm running out of time, Elisabet.

2
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,810
The land is dying.

3
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,762
People are suffering.

4
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,265
Soon they'll starve.

5
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:29,355
All because of a terraforming system that's spiralling out of control.

6
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,242
And only I can fix it.

7
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:34,594
Only I have your genetic code.

8
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:40,867
It won't be long before we hit the point of no return and then extinction.

9
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,553
I've been searching for months for what I need.

10
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:05,558
A backup of Gaia, the AI you designed to control the system.

11
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:10,129
But every time I think I have a lead, it comes to nothing.

12
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,834
And every night I have the same dream.

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,249
I'm walking under a brilliant night sky through a field of flowers.

14
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,918
And when I arrive at the centre…

15
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,288
I see you, Elisabet.

16
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:41,628
Waiting for me, even though you've been dead for a thousand years.

17
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,412
You're the closest person I've ever had to a mother

18
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,752
And for a moment I feel whole.

19
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,570
But it never lasts.

20
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,023
I'm always left alone.

21
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,955
This world is your legacy, Elisabet.

22
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,224
I won't let it slip away.

23
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,604
The valley below is my only remaining lead.

24
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,323
My last hope to find the backup.

25
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,543
I'll do whatever it takes to get it, I promise.

26
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,910
Varl?

27
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,378
[Varl laughs]

28
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,667
If it isn't Aloy, the saviour of Meridian, Anointed of the Nora.

29
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,236
You know I hate being called that stuff.

30
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:36,075
Well, consider it a punishment for running out on us
the very same night we beat Hades.

31
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,680
I grew up an outcast, remember, I'm not much for parties.

32
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,565
VARL: Yeah…

33
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,986
But that one was in your honour, just saying.

34
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,189
VARL: So!

35
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,275
VARL: What are we doing?

36
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,495
VARL: Must be urgent since you left so fast.

37
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,083
Delving into ancient ruins.

38
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,288
Or maybe it has something to do with the blight.

39
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,692
ALOY: Both actually, but, um…

40
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,695
ALOY: I should…
VARL: Oh no.

41
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,764
I've been tracking you a long way.

42
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,898
It's okay.

43
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,018
After everything you've done to help the Nora and my family.

44
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,938
I swore an oath to help you no matter what.

45
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,589
You're stuck with me now.

46
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,592
Like bark on wood.

47
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,875
Okay, but if you're going to come with me, you'll need to be able to see what I see.

48
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,693
Huh!

49
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,046
A Focus!

50
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,100
Never thought I'd get your second sight.

51
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:55,588
I'll give you another one later and show you how to backup your data.

52
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,140
"Data"?

53
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,094
Information on the device, we've got a lot to cover.

54
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,679
Um, I'll have to explain everything as we go.

55
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,794
You see like this all the time?

56
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,595
Since I was a little girl.

57
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,180
Come on.

58
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,299
Shall we?

59
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:56,966
ALOY: Alright, I got a couple of scrapes on the way here.

60
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,786
ALOY: We should find some medicinal plants, stock up.

61
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,372
ALOY: So it's time for your first lesson with the Focus.

62
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:06,092
VARL: Sounds good, let's get started.

63
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,000
VARL: These plants don't look like the ones in the Sacred Lands.

64
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,136
ALOY: The Focus helps you see the ones we need.

65
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,577
ALOY: There! Those plants by the stream should do the trick.

66
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,270
ALOY: Ugh.
VARL: Bitter?

67
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,073
ALOY: Yeah, well, at least they make you feel better.

68
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,192
ALOY: Alright, we should keep going.

69
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,796
VARL: You might want to grab more of these plants along the way.

70
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,299
ALOY: Yeah, good idea.

71
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,286
ALOY: Ground is stained red.

72
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,816
[Aloy coughing]

73
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,887
ALOY: Ugh, the blight's infecting all the plants.

74
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,488
ALOY: It's changing them.

75
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,576
VARL: If it keeps spreading, nothing will grow.

76
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,095
ALOY: That's why we have to fix it.

77
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,700
ALOY: Those ruins, that's where we need to go.

78
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,686
VARL: I see a few ways down.

79
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,890
VARL: What are we after, exactly?

80
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,276
ALOY: The backup? Well, um…

81
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:25,598
ALOY: It's an AI. It's, um, it's hard to explain.

82
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,387
ALOY: Think of it like a set of instructions that can fix the world.

83
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,089
VARL: Sounds complicated.

84
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,576
VARL: Noticed you're travelling light these days.

85
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:41,147
ALOY: Yeah, I ran into some trouble on the way here.

86
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,898
ALOY: Lost a lot of my gear.

87
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:50,289
ALOY: I don't know who put these ropes here, but we can use the line to slide down.

88
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,891
VARL: Find anything good?

89
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,793
ALOY: A few supplies.

90
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,596
VARL: More of the red growth here too.

91
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,386
VARL: You really travelled a long way to get here.

92
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,189
VARL: I almost caught up to you a couple of times, too.

93
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,492
VARL: But it's not easy keeping up with a machine rider.

94
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,011
ALOY: You always were a good tracker.

95
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:26,385
[Aloy coughing]

96
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,663
ALOY: Glinthawks.

97
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:57,600
VARL: Salvaging machine carcasses as usual.

98
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,485
VARL: And there they go.

99
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,188
ALOY: Looks like they left a carcass behind.

100
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,999
A lot of arrows in that machine.

101
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,285
Better take a closer look.

102
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,476
ALOY: Someone took down this machine recently.

103
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,094
VARL: Who else would come here?

104
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:16,796
ALOY: I don't know.

105
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,498
ALOY: We'd better craft some arrows of our own.

106
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,767
ALOY: There might be trouble up ahead.

107
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,686
VARL: There's some Ridge-Wood by the stream.

108
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,298
ALOY: Alright, now to craft some arrows.

109
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,791
ALOY: Done.

110
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,794
VARL: Me too, arrows ready.

111
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,545
VARL: There's a ladder.

112
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,398
VARL: But can't reach it from here.

113
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:12,184
ALOY: Nothing a well placed arrow can't knock free.

114
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,486
ALOY: Just have to target the lock.

115
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,689
VARL: That did it.

116
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:18,791
VARL: After you.

117
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,794
VARL: By the Goddess.

118
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,581
ALOY: What was this place?

119
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,936
ALOY: I don't know. The transmission…

120
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,057
ALOY: …the message I found didn't say.

121
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,276
ALOY: Only that a backup might be here.

122
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,395
ALOY: We need to find a way in.

123
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,185
ALOY: So, um, what happened after I left Meridian?

124
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,089
VARL: Well, there was a fuss when people realised you were gone.

125
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,477
VARL: But then some of us figured you only would have left
if it were for something important.

126
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,479
ALOY: You were right about that.

127
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,288
VARL: We should find another way.

128
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:07,986
ALOY: Down this way.

129
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,485
ALOY: Get to the grass.

130
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,856
VARL: Never seen one of those before.

131
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,208
ALOY: Me neither.

132
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,598
ALOY: Those dead machines have it on alert.

133
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,300
VARL: How do you want to handle it?

134
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,118
The Focus can help us.

135
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,239
ALOY: We can scan the machine before we make our move.

136
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,374
VARL: Okay.

137
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,743
ALOY: Give it a second…

138
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,429
ALOY: Okay, see how parts of it are glowing?

139
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,864
ALOY: Those are its weak spots.

140
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,981
VARL: Got it.

141
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,490
VARL: It's eye, it's a weak spot.

142
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,075
ALOY: Right!

143
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,711
VARL: I'm ready.

144
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,486
ALOY: Okay, concentrate.

145
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,298
VARL: Another one's coming!

146
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,121
VARL: How does the Focus know all that?

147
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,740
ALOY: It reads data on the machine.

148
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,876
VARL: Like a hunter studying its prey?

149
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,878
ALOY: Yeah, kind of.

150
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:23,589
ALOY: So, after the fuss over me leaving, what did everyone else do?

151
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:28,894
VARL: Well, as soon as the celebration was over,
my mother led the rest of the Nora home.

152
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,798
VARL: Sun-King put his people to work rebuilding the city.

153
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,500
VARL: And I set out to find you.

154
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,195
VARL: Someone shot this machine too.

155
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:55,187
ALOY: Another ladder, need to shoot off the lock.

156
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,076
ALOY: Got it.

157
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,095
VARL: You said you've had a Focus since you were a child, right?

158
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,599
ALOY: Yeah, I found my first one when I fell into a ruin.

159
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,486
ALOY: Got the others from an old cache not long ago.

160
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,805
ALOY: It's good to have extras.

161
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,988
VARL: Going into a ruin of the Old Ones.

162
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,374
VARL: Goddess protect us.

163
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,809
ALOY: We'll be okay, Varl.

164
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,702
ALOY: Through here.

165
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,890
COMPUTER: Welcome to the Far Zenith Launch Facility.

166
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,709
ALOY: Far Zenith?

167
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,696
ALOY: I know they made some tech trades with Zero Dawn, but…

168
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,699
ALOY: …why would they have a backup of Gaia?

169
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,919
COMPUTER: Please register with reception for the tour.

170
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,488
VARL: I guess they want us to check in with them?

171
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,047
COMPUTER: Please hold for Identiscan.

172
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,615
COMPUTER: Access denied.

173
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,886
COMPUTER: Please wait here for personnel to assist you, Dr Sobeck.

174
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:55,707
ALOY: Okay, I guess they weren't on great terms with Elisabet.

175
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,794
ALOY: Well, let's find a way in.

176
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,602
COMPUTER: Please hold for Identiscan.

177
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:11,690
COMPUTER: Access denied, credentials not recognised.

178
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,809
VARL: I guess it doesn't like me either.

179
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,797
ALOY: I should be able to pry this open.

180
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,475
ALOY: There's climbing gear.

181
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,294
ALOY: Guess someone dropped in from above.

182
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:16,087
ALOY: Whoever left this here might have also shot those machines we found earlier.

183
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,956
VARL: So where are they now?

184
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,804
VARL: Ugh, what's that stench?

185
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,595
ALOY: An entire camp wiped out.

186
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,949
ALOY: They must have come here to delve for scrap.

187
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,801
VARL: Acid, that explains the smell.

188
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,339
VARL: And it looks like something big came in from above.

189
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:53,375
ALOY: Crashed right through the camp.

190
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:55,994
ALOY: Then through the wall.

191
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,711
ALOY: Whatever came through here brought this down as it went out.

192
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:17,699
ALOY: If I can dislodge some of the debris, we might be able to squeeze through.

193
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,585
ALOY: Maybe I can find something to help in the camp.

194
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:22,988
VARL: Aloy, over here.

195
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,307
VARL: I think I got something.

196
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:33,732
VARL: It's some kind of Oseram prototype, I think.

197
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,618
VARL: This hook looks like it can latch onto things.

198
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,288
ALOY: And this gear pulls it back, hmm.

199
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:45,343
VARL: It looks broken but maybe we can repair it, hook it to the debris…

200
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,979
ALOY: …and pull it out. That could work.

201
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,586
The Focus can help us search the camp and identify anything we can use to fix the tool.

202
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,900
VARL: Poor guy.

203
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,586
VARL: Acid burned right through his armour.

204
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,000
VARL: A lot of supplies here.

205
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,986
VARL: I guess they planned to stay awhile.

206
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,697
ALOY: Machine cable, stronger than rope.

207
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,607
ALOY: Part of a machine, could help fix the gears.

208
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:08,910
ALOY: Alright, I think I have what I need to repair the tool.

209
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:11,730
ALOY: Or maybe even make something better.

210
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,882
VARL: You could use this workbench.

211
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:45,196
ALOY: There, a … "Pullcaster".

212
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,982
ALOY: Now to test it on the debris.

213
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,427
VARL: Whoa!

214
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,995
ALOY: That worked better than I thought.

215
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,206
ALOY: Well, it doesn't look like there's an easy way out of here.

216
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,826
ALOY: I should scan the area, we have to find a way to keep going.

217
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:33,378
VARL: Huh, what's this thing for?

218
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:46,408
ALOY: What's this?

219
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,517
VARL: Whoa.

220
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:59,037
DALGAARD: Good morning, I'm Osvald Dalgaard.

221
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:04,392
DALGAARD: And it is my pleasure to introduce you to Far Zenith.

222
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,530
DALGAARD: Forget what you think you know about us.

223
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,999
DALGAARD: Our truth is simple.

224
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,067
DALGAARD: We say reach for the stars.

225
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:17,722
DALGAARD: Even if you have to cross 8.6 light years of space to get there.

226
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:23,478
DALGAARD: Please proceed into the auditorium where we'll unveil our plans.

227
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,301
VARL: Wonder what's in this "auditorium"?

228
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,687
ALOY: Guess we'll find out.

229
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,996
ALOY: Oh, I might be able to get up there.

230
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:54,809
ALOY: Wow, that worked.

231
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:57,545
VARL: That Pullcaster is useful.

232
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,714
VARL: Too bad there's only one.

233
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,717
ALOY: Don't worry, I'll find you another way up.

234
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,957
ALOY: Okay, I gotta drop the ladder for Varl.

235
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:08,399
ALOY: Supplies. I think I can use the Pullcaster on it.

236
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,289
ALOY: There you go, Varl.

237
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,490
VARL: Thanks.

238
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,084
DALGAARD: Humans, Homo Sapiens, us.

239
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:06,207
DALGAARD: We have always pushed the boundary as explorers, pioneers, trailblazers.

240
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:10,795
DALGAARD: And now Far Zenith is taking the next leap into the future.

241
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:14,766
DALGAARD: That's why we're proud to have resurrected the Odyssey.

242
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:20,989
DALGAARD: What our governments abandoned in orbit, Far Zenith will actualise in less than a decade.

243
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,391
DALGAARD: But that's only the beginning.

244
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:31,799
DALGAARD: When the ship is complete, we will send
the Odyssey and her crew where no-one's gone before.

245
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,291
DALGAARD: The Sirius system.

246
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:47,799
DALGAARD: There we'll create humanity's first off-world colony.

247
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,204
DALGAARD: The Odyssey may take 300 years to reach it.

248
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:57,875
DALGAARD: But when we look up at the night sky, we'll know they're on their way.

249
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,749
DALGAARD: And, in the words of our founder, the late Peter Tshivhumbe…

250
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,852
DALGAARD: "The truest form of immortality is—"

251
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:11,155
COMPUTER: Data corrupt, playback stopped.

252
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,658
VARL: The Old Ones could fly through the sky?

253
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:15,893
VARL: Between the stars?!

254
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:22,467
ALOY: Uhh, well, yes, sort of.

255
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:27,188
ALOY: That ship, the Odyssey? It never made it to the other star.

256
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:30,291
ALOY: Something went wrong and it blew up.

257
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,892
ALOY: Is that why Elisabet gave them a backup of Gaia? For their colony?

258
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,831
COMPUTER: Error, public presentation file corrupted.

259
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,334
COMPUTER: Member recruitment file available.

260
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,802
COMPUTER: Do you wish to reactivate?

261
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,038
ALOY: Yeah, reactivate.

262
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,490
ALOY: Let's see what else they had to say.

263
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,283
DALGAARD: We all know the projections.

264
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:18,272
DALGAARD: Economic instability, new biocontagions, rampant AIs.

265
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:24,195
DALGAARD: How long before another catastrophe creates unacceptable risk for the world's elite?

266
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,383
DALGAARD: We here at Far Zenith believe: escape the inevitable.

267
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,370
DALGAARD: And so we reach for the stars.

268
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,793
DALGAARD: Now you've seen what we're building here.

269
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:42,296
DALGAARD: Infrastructure to support the Odyssey's construction.

270
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:47,535
DALGAARD: A state-of-the-art data centre to facilitate rapid technological advancements.

271
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,806
DALGAARD: And you've seen how we're managing public perception.

272
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:55,276
DALGAARD: So invest and join us.

273
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:58,296
DALGAARD: Claim your berth on the Odyssey.

274
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:03,067
DALGAARD: Preserve your way of life beyond the concerns of Earth.

275
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,637
ALOY: Well, they were right about the world ending.

276
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,707
ALOY: They just didn't know how … yet.

277
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:16,697
VARL: So everything they said back there about the next step for humanity,
it was all a lie.

278
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:22,136
VARL: These people only cared about saving their own skin.

279
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:25,706
ALOY: Yeah, well, didn't work out for them in the end.

280
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:32,029
ALOY: That Osvald guy mentioned a data centre.

281
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:47,195
ALOY: There, the backup, it should be stored in there.

282
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,986
VARL: Won't be able to swim across.

283
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,689
ALOY: I guess we'll have to find a way around. Come on.

284
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,504
VARL: I still can't believe the Old Ones could fly.

285
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,224
ALOY: They were capable of a lot of things.

286
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,709
ALOY: For good and bad.

287
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,611
VARL: Sure seems like it.

288
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:25,166
VARL: I wonder what it's like up there among the stars.

289
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,207
VARL: The wilds have really grown over this place.

290
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,379
ALOY: Deeper into the creepy ruin we go.

291
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:11,245
VARL: Above us. What is that thing?

292
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,316
ALOY: I don't know. Might've been what killed those Oseram.

293
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,118
ALOY: Keep your guard up.

294
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,520
VARL: Oh, my guard is up.

295
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,927
[Aloy coughing]

296
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:28,312
ALOY: Ugh, it's hard to breathe around this stuff.

297
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,166
ALOY: Up here.

298
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,628
Careful, don't want those things to call in some friends from underground.

299
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,914
ALOY: Let's take them out quietly.

300
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,784
You take the left one, I'll deal with the one on the right.

301
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,918
Okay.

302
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:17,812
VARL: Moving up.

303
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:21,599
ALOY: I need to sneak up on it to take it out with my spear.

304
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,401
ALOY: Can't let it see me.

305
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:27,488
ALOY: I should scan it first, check its patrol path.

306
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:31,292
ALOY: Okay, there is its patrol path.

307
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,613
ALOY: Gotta get closer and stay out of sight.

308
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,836
ALOY: I can throw a rock to distract it.

309
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:45,206
ALOY: Get it into a position where I can sneak up and strike.

310
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,309
ALOY: Just have to wait for the right moment

311
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,249
ALOY: Time to throw.

312
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,120
ALOY: Ah, there.

313
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,706
ALOY: Now to take it down with a spear strike.

314
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:09,797
ALOY: Gotcha!

315
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,488
VARL: Mine's down too.

316
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,900
VARL: More of those machines ahead.

317
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,219
ALOY: Nothing you and I can't handle.

318
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:26,794
ALOY: Got 'em all.

319
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:31,398
ALOY: I've been meaning to mention…

320
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:35,019
ALOY: I noticed you have a new look these days.

321
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:37,571
VARL: [laughs] Yeah, I know.

322
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:41,191
VARL: Didn't have a lot of time to shave when I was trying to catch up to you.

323
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,677
VARL: Don't worry, it's not permanent.

324
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,079
ALOY: Good.

325
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:49,049
VARL: Sorry my whiskers offend you "Anointed".

326
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:57,925
ALOY: Looks like this little guy got caught up in the blight.

327
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,793
ALOY: Couldn't escape.

328
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,479
VARL: I hope it didn't suffer long.

329
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:33,978
ALOY: The Oseram must've used explosives against the machines.

330
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,280
VARL: They managed to get a couple.

331
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,379
ALOY: Looks like there was a barricade here.

332
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,782
ALOY: Machines must have broken through.

333
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,782
ALOY: I'll keep this for later.

334
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,152
VARL: I guess that Oseram didn't have a chance to use it.

335
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,848
VARL: Careful! Traps ahead.

336
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:30,584
ALOY: Huh. Might be able to disarm them.

337
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,878
ALOY: There, managed to salvage some supplies.

338
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,880
VARL: And not blow yourself up.

339
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,578
ALOY: Looks like another camp.

340
00:44:57,578 --> 00:45:00,881
VARL: While we're here, maybe we can make some traps of our own.

341
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:03,283
VARL: Might come in handy against the machines.

342
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,468
ALOY: Good idea.

343
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,956
ALOY: I can use this.

344
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:51,782
ALOY: Okay, should have what I need to craft a trap.

345
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,763
ALOY: There, explosive trap made.

346
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:27,117
VARL: If anything walks into one of those, it won't know what hit it.

347
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:30,170
VARL: I think I see a way up.

348
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:43,884
ALOY: Machines ahead.

349
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,969
VARL: Don't think they spotted us.

350
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:48,338
ALOY: I'd better scan them.

351
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,660
VARL: I've seen this machine before, a Scrounger.

352
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:55,562
ALOY: Well, it's new to me.

353
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,065
ALOY: Let's see where its weak points are.

354
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,869
Maybe we could place one of those traps you made in its path.

355
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,972
ALOY: Set this here.

356
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,464
VARL: Right into the trap!

357
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,449
VARL: We're clear.

358
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,168
ALOY: Let's keep going, then.

359
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,448
VARL: You've been in a lot of Old World ruins.

360
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,450
VARL: Are they all like this?

361
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:45,172
ALOY: They all have their secrets, but every place is different.

362
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:20,207
VARL: Whoa, that machine we saw earlier must be on the move.

363
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:22,859
ALOY: Well, let's hope it doesn't come this way.

364
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,161
VARL: That's a big storm picking up out there.

365
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:03,650
ALOY: Yeah, and they're getting stronger and more frequent.

366
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:08,638
VARL: So the storms, the blighted lands, the rivers and lakes choked with algae.

367
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,041
ALOY: You were born to fix all that?

368
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,961
ALOY: Yeah, but I can only do it if I find that backup.

369
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:18,248
ALOY: I think we're winding our way around to the data centre.

370
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,752
ALOY: We'll need to cut through that big building on the right out there.

371
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,846
VARL: What's in here?

372
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,950
VARL: Aloy, come check this out.

373
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:47,728
VARL: What is this thing?

374
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,347
ALOY: It's … data.

375
00:50:51,031 --> 00:50:53,083
ALOY: You can scan it, with your Focus.

376
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,953
VARL: Let's see.

377
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,123
VARL: Huh, a lot of glyphs.

378
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,360
VARL: I'll tuck this away to study later.

379
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:12,152
ALOY: This data mentions the tech that Far Zenith traded with Zero Dawn…

380
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:14,654
ALOY: …but it doesn't explain how they got a backup.

381
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:17,541
VARL: I'll keep an eye out for more data.

382
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,207
ALOY: Looks like we've got to climb up.

383
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:48,839
VARL: You okay?

384
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:50,357
ALOY: Yeah.

385
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:52,542
ALOY: Guess we won't be going that way.

386
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,148
VARL: This place is really falling apart.

387
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,084
ALOY: Well, it is a thousand years old.

388
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,734
VARL: Made it.

389
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,538
ALOY: Looks like some kind of meeting room.

390
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,241
ALOY: The door on the other side's locked.

391
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:44,227
VARL: There's another one of those glowing things by the table.

392
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:55,739
ALOY: "Anzu"?

393
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:02,062
VOICE: The Zero Dawn terraforming system.

394
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:04,915
VOICE: The brainchild of Dr Elisabet Sobeck.

395
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,267
VOICE: Empowered by nine subordinate functions…

396
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:13,907
VOICE: Gaia, the core of the system, is capable of advanced planetary engineering.

397
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,177
VOICE: An obvious advantage to our space colonisation efforts.

398
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,129
VOICE: Operation Phase One.

399
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:24,084
VOICE: Establish an asset within Project Zero Dawn. Status: complete.

400
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:28,955
VOICE: Phase Two. The asset will secretly beamcast a complete copy of Gaia…

401
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,609
VOICE: …and her subordinate functions to this facility's data centre.

402
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:37,380
VOICE: If all goes well, Zero Dawn staff will remain completely unaware of the transmission.

403
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:45,372
VOICE: Risks. Discovery of this operation could result in Zero Dawn withholding the already negotiated Apollo database.

404
00:53:45,372 --> 00:53:51,711
VOICE: Special care must be taken not to alert Travis Tate, the expert hacker in charge of Hades protocol.

405
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:58,919
VOICE: In addition, extreme caution must be exercised in regards to Dr Sobeck herself.

406
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:06,109
VOICE: As one of the world's preeminent technologists, she may have instituted unforeseen security measures.

407
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,044
VOICE: A complete assessment is attached.

408
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:11,298
VOICE: This concludes the executive summary.

409
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,021
I thought Elisabet sent the backup here, but she didn't.

410
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:22,025
Far Zenith stole Gaia.

411
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,512
Aloy, why does that woman look like you?

412
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,099
ALOY: Ah, um, it's okay Varl.

413
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:36,006
We look alike because we're the exact same, genetically identical.

414
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,141
But she was one of the Old Ones.

415
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,226
How can you be her?

416
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,631
Because I wasn't born.

417
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:49,319
I was made, by a machine.

418
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:51,988
It's why I'm motherless.

419
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,642
Why I was cast out as an infant.

420
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,427
I don't understand.

421
00:54:58,311 --> 00:55:00,597
What kind of machine can make a person?

422
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:04,367
Remember when I said the backup is like a set of instructions? 

423
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,020
It's more than that.

424
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,872
It's called Gaia.

425
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:15,545
ALOY: And for a long time she cared for the world until she had to destroy herself.

426
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:20,533
ALOY: So she made me to bring her back.

427
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:22,819
I'm the only one who can.

428
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,640
And this place is my last hope.

429
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:33,329
You once said the Goddess spoke to you when you went into All-Mother Mountain.

430
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,349
Was that this Gaia?

431
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:42,122
Yes, but, she's not the Goddess, Varl.

432
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,390
There isn't one.

433
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,824
How can you be sure?

434
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,528
It sounds like she anointed you with a sacred task.

435
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,532
I've had a lot of time to figure this out.

436
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:54,651
And you will too, with the Focus.

437
00:55:54,651 --> 00:56:01,124
But, for now, the report said they were going to store the stolen copy of Gaia in the data centre.

438
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,760
So that's where we have to go, okay?

439
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:20,710
VARL: Huh, look at that.

440
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:24,898
VARL: Aloy, over here, I found something you could use. 

441
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,870
VARL: Those Oseram must've left this behind.

442
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,724
VARL: Can't help them, but it can help us.

443
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,214
ALOY: A weapon. Thanks, Varl.

444
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,234
ALOY: We should keep moving.

445
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,418
VARL: After you.

446
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,222
ALOY: Down here!

447
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,428
ALOY: I think we're almost back outside.

448
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:29,813
VARL: Good.

449
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,013
VARL: Look, that must be the machine.

450
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,767
ALOY: It's heading in the same direction we're going.

451
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:52,185
ALOY: Great.

452
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,141
ALOY: Another one of those machines.

453
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,627
ALOY: I could try out the new weapon I have.

454
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,089
VARL: Good hit!

455
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,610
ALOY: I can do more damage to it while it's brittle.

456
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,752
VARL: It's already brittle, Aloy.

457
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,155
ALOY: Gotcha!

458
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,907
VARL: Machine couldn't take the cold.

459
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:54,347
ALOY: More of the Oseram delvers.

460
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,916
ALOY: And a lot of acid.

461
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,837
ALOY: That big machine must have attacked as they tried to escape.

462
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,423
ALOY: They didn't stand a chance.

463
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:18,004
VARL: So … you said this backup is the last hope?

464
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,856
ALOY: Yeah.

465
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:25,612
ALOY: All those places I've been these last few months, they were supposed to be more backups.

466
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,417
ALOY: But a thousand years ago, a guy named Ted Faro purged them all.

467
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:33,886
VARL: Was he part of Far Zenith, too?

468
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:34,804
ALOY: No.

469
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,873
ALOY: He was worse.
