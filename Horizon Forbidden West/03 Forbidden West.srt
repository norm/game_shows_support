1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,139
MARAD: Something happened at the Spire.

2
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,611
MARAD: Come, I'll show you.

3
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:32,866
ALOY: The Spire is supposed to send out
signals — messages — for the terraforming system.

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,186
VARL: But Hades tried to use it to wake up ancient war machines.

5
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,338
ALOY: I was sure I cut the connection to that thing.

6
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,032
Somewhere to the far West.

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,352
SYLENS: I see you finally figured it out.

8
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:57,474
SYLENS: To be honest, I'm surprised it took you so long to discover my ruse.

9
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,493
You rigged the lance to steal Hades.

10
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,979
I've made progress.

11
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,567
SYLENS: So once your anger
at my entirely necessary deception has faded…

12
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,354
SYLENS: …well, why don't you come out here
and find me in the Forbidden West…

13
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:14,424
SYLENS: …and learn all that I have discovered.

14
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,210
ALOY: Oh, I'll come find you, alright.

15
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,284
VARL: You went inside it and it transformed,
almost like the day of the battle.

16
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,686
MARAD: I can only be grateful that it's a stormy day.

17
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,239
Few will have seen the tower change from Meridian.

18
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,741
What did you discover?

19
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,443
ALOY: Hades.

20
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,845
ALOY: The danger didn't end here.

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,947
ALOY: It went into the Forbidden West.

22
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:40,066
ALOY: And I have to follow.

23
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,036
MARAD: I see. That can be difficult.

24
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,240
The West is called forbidden for a reason.

25
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:52,028
A tribe of ferocious warriors controls much of it, the Tenakth.

26
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,547
MARAD: And they allow no trespassers past its border.

27
00:01:55,315 --> 00:02:01,304
MARAD: That said, under the Sun-King Avad,
a fragile peace has been negotiated.

28
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,426
MARAD: And indeed, the next Embassy will take place
in a day or two on the edge of the frontier.

29
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:11,214
MARAD: Were you to attend the gathering under his auspices,

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,683
MARAD: the Tenakth might grant right of passage,

31
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,986
MARAD: instead of hunting you and attacking on sight.

32
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:20,306
Great, just what I need — more killers.

33
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,593
MARAD: Ah, the Sun-King.

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,170
AVAD: Aloy, it's good to see you.

35
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,158
You left in such haste we never had a chance to properly thank you.

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,977
ITAMEN: Can— can we show the Champion the spear now? Please?

37
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,129
NASADI: Itamen, quiet.

38
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,115
AVAD: It's true, we bear gifts.

39
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,636
AVAD: Decorum usually calls for a ceremony of offering at the palace.

40
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,039
AVAD: But I thought you would prefer a less formal occasion.

41
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:54,724
AVAD: Bring them, please!

42
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,260
ALOY: Avad, this is all very kind, but I —

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,263
VANASHA: Quick, better hand them over before she runs off again.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,499
UTHID: Really? Must you?

45
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,947
VARL: Try it on.

46
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,921
ALOY: It's beautiful.

47
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,507
AVAD: On behalf of all the citizens of the Sundom…

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,661
AVAD: …may these tokens remind you of our eternal gratitude.

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,176
MARAD: Perhaps you'd like to spend more time with your friends.

50
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,146
MARAD: Come speak to me when you're ready to depart.

51
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,741
I need to attach the Master Override to my new spear.

52
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,911
Should be a workbench around here I can use.

53
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,660
NASADI: Manners, Itamen. Now come and stand beside me.

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,681
Dowager Queen Nasadi.

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,751
NASADI: Blessed Champion. Itamen, what do you say?

56
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,773
My humblest thanks to you, great Champion.

57
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,992
For delivering my mother and me from Sunfall.

58
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:39,262
ITAMEN: And for defending our holy city against the forces of shadow.

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,547
Did I say it right?

60
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,550
You said it fine, Itamen.

61
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,085
And you're welcome.

62
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,056
Champion, will you teach me how to shoot like a real machine hunter?

63
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,007
Itamen!

64
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,795
I have to go on an important mission, Prince.

65
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,863
To save the world?

66
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,298
Something like that.

67
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:04,220
But when I come back, I could give you a few tips.

68
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:05,888
It would be an honour.

69
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,695
NASADI: We owe you our lives, Champion, and we will not forget.

70
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,897
NASADI: May the Sun light your way.

71
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,400
ITAMEN: Watch out for Thunderjaws, Champion!

72
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:22,488
ITAMEN: Is it true you and Talanah killed Redmaw? Marad said it's true.

73
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:28,077
NASADI: Hush child! Marad should know better
than to fill your head with such stories.

74
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,197
ITAMEN: But his stories are the only ones that aren't boring.

75
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,951
ADVISER: Shipments continue to arrive weekly through Cut-Cliffs.

76
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,988
ADVISER: And another band of Oseram labourers
have been hired to speed up reconstruction.

77
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,007
AVAD: Very good.

78
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,844
ALOY: Is that a statue of me?

79
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,231
AVAD: The sculptor wanted something even bigger.

80
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,901
AVAD: Twice the size, covered in gold and jewels.

81
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,455
AVAD: But I was quite certain you wouldn't appreciate that.

82
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,306
ALOY: You were right.

83
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,997
ALOY: I'm sorry, Avad.

84
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,801
AVAD: It's good to see you, but I can't stay long.

85
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,002
AVAD: I see.

86
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,407
AVAD: I'd hoped you'd remain in the city for a time.

87
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,559
AVAD: Perhaps at the palace.

88
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,897
ALOY: Meridian's still in danger, but it's bigger than that.

89
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,000
ALOY: To put things right, I have to go west.

90
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,502
ALOY: Tenakth territory.

91
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,888
AVAD: By the Sun! The Tenakth?

92
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,043
AVAD: Well, perhaps Marad already told you, but…

93
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:37,296
AVAD: After years of hostility, we've negotiated a truce.

94
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,198
AVAD: And hopes of a lasting peace.

95
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,984
AVAD: Another Embassy will be held in just a day or two.

96
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,054
"Years of hostility" — I assume you mean the Red Raids?

97
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:48,191
Ah, yes, my favourite subject.

98
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,710
I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to know.

99
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:54,881
As you know, my father raided all the border tribes.

100
00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:00,770
The Oseram, Banuk, and Nora suffered greatly,
resisting as best they could.

101
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,856
But none fought back like the Tenakth.

102
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,293
They rose up and assaulted our western front of Barren Light.

103
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,162
Sweeping us from their lands.

104
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,100
AVAD: Getting them to talk to us again after that was … tricky.

105
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,886
How did you get the Tenakth to talk again?

106
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:19,071
The same way I got you to talk.

107
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,606
By giving gifts.

108
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,243
The Tenakth like tiaras?

109
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:29,365
More like metals, spices, and relics looted during the fighting.

110
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,654
We've met with them on several occasions,
and the gifts seem to have eased the tension.

111
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,090
But this coming Embassy is the most important yet.

112
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,794
The best sign we've had so far that the Tenakth want lasting peace.

113
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:45,314
What makes this coming Embassy so special?

114
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:49,051
Well, just like today, it is special because of the guest.

115
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,806
Our delegation will meet with the Tenakth just outside Barren Light.

116
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,993
We'll give them treasure and they'll return a prisoner.

117
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,329
Fashav, one of our finest soldiers.

118
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,216
Soldier? Don't you mean Raider?

119
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,085
No, not in this case.

120
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,720
Fashav is my cousin.

121
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,755
Nothing like Helis and his ilk.

122
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,594
He joined the Western Expedition with the hopes
of reining in certain excesses.

123
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:20,066
AVAD: But he was captured during a heroic defence
of our forward base at Cinnabar Sands.

124
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,585
And has been held ever since.

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,421
How long has he been a Tenakth captive?

126
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,724
Five years.

127
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,445
Tenakth emissaries swear he is well.

128
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,363
But I wonder.

129
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,416
That tribe is renowned for its brutality.

130
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,268
How did he survive?

131
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,006
Well, I'll know soon enough.

132
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,860
If you see him before I do…

133
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,430
Tell him that I await him in Meridian, where he belongs.

134
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,933
Itamen looks happy.

135
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,419
AVAD: You got him out of Sunfall.

136
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,322
AVAD: Any happiness he has, he owes to you.

137
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,960
He's turning into a fine young man.

138
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,979
Which he'll need to be if he is to inherit the crown.

139
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,865
Wouldn't the crown go to a son of yours first?

140
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,450
Yes, well.

141
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,536
I'd have to get married for that to happen.

142
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,020
I'd have to get married for that to happen.

143
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,725
Marad keeps throwing noble matches at me.

144
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,496
But I find I'm always…

145
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:27,433
…trying to make them into someone they're not.

146
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,622
AVAD: At any rate, I never aspired to the throne.

147
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:34,941
And I don't wish to sit there forever.

148
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,227
When Itamen comes of age, I hope to step aside.

149
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,030
Free of the crown.

150
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,216
I might finally be able to travel the world.

151
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,871
Who knows, perhaps even accompany you on one of your adventures?

152
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:49,889
I need to get going.

153
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,190
AVAD: Ah, one moment Aloy!

154
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,376
There's something I must ask you.

155
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,495
Since you left, I've thought of little else.

156
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:58,064
This isn't really the time.

157
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,565
But it has to be.

158
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,203
The way you left before, there's no way to know when I'll see you again.

159
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,141
I'm not trying to stop you or hold you back.

160
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,459
But I need to know.

161
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,795
When your mission is over.

162
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,782
Will you return to Meridian, and stay?

163
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,687
Long enough for us to … spend time to …

164
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,540
… get to know each other properly, perhaps?

165
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:30,196
Avad, the situation calls for … a higher perspective.

166
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,285
The threat I'm facing endangers not just Meridian,
but a lot of other places too.

167
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,953
A lot of innocent people.

168
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,793
What happens between us … it's not important.

169
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,296
At least not yet.

170
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,065
You're right.

171
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,767
I'm acting like a fool.

172
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,955
It's supposed to be the king who calls for a higher perspective.

173
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,674
I do hope to see Meridian again, Avad.

174
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,876
And you.

175
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:07,149
But, this mission, it's my life.

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,719
It's all I can think about.

177
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,288
I have to stay focused.

178
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,641
What happens after?

179
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,594
I can't imagine that.

180
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,280
I wouldn't know where to begin.

181
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:24,734
If that place were to end up being Meridian…

182
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:27,903
…know that you will always receive a boundless welcome here.

183
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,990
Tend to your mission, Aloy.

184
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,142
I will hope for your success.

185
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,996
As always, our hopes ride with you.

186
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,291
There, the workbench.

187
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,377
Okay, Master Override installed.

188
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:32,284
Plus something new to store up and release energy.

189
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,522
A "resonator". Should help in a fight.

190
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,764
ALOY: Uthid. Vanasha.

191
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,765
Thanks for being here.

192
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,833
VANASHA: Wouldn't miss it.

193
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,636
Even if you did leave us hanging after the big battle.

194
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,087
UTHID: Vanasha, stop.

195
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,823
She's here now, isn't she?

196
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,357
VANASHA: For the moment.

197
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,209
But I see that look on her face.

198
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,395
She's got business to attend to.

199
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,580
And it isn't in Meridian.

200
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,568
You know, I didn't vanish before because I wanted to, I had—

201
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:08,420
Little huntress, please.

202
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,856
You don't have to justify yourself to us.

203
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,658
You saved our butts.

204
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,077
If you've got to go, go.

205
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,879
With our blessing.

206
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,330
UTHID: Always.

207
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:21,550
You both look like you're doing well.

208
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,738
VANASHA: Mr Shiny Pants here is now
the Sun-King's senior military adviser.

209
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:29,058
That means people actually have to listen to him talk.

210
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,193
May the Sun bless their sorry souls.

211
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:34,864
UTHID: At least I say something of substance every once in a while.

212
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,665
What was that?

213
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,734
I just fell asleep while you were talking.

214
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,653
ALOY: And how about you, Vanasha?

215
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,289
I've been looking after Nasadi and Itamen.

216
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,074
Two parts bodyguard, one part—

217
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,392
UTHID: Bad influence.

218
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,112
VANAHSA: Ha! I was going to say nanny, but I like your version better.

219
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,481
ALOY: I never pictured you as a nanny.

220
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,616
Itamen must be special.

221
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:54,700
VANASHA: Hold on now!

222
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,952
I'm not entirely domesticated.

223
00:13:56,952 --> 00:14:00,122
Nasadi was the Mad Sun-King's wife, she has enemies.

224
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,458
I've had to foil a plot or two.

225
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:08,364
UTHID: Right. You can try to hide it,
but inside you're as soft as a silk pillow.

226
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,383
VANASHA: Oh, you have no idea.

227
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,869
UTHID: Uh, oh dear.

228
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,171
ALOY: Uhhh, we were talking about Itamen?

229
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,973
VANASHA: Okay, I admit it.

230
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:21,260
Itamen's cute, he's fun, and he looks up to me.

231
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,828
I like him.

232
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,600
Except when he forgets to wash his hands after hooking worms
in that muddy garden behind his solarium.

233
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,784
Bleech!

234
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,870
It's been months since I was in Sunfall.

235
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,772
What's become of the Shadow Carja?

236
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:39,178
VANASHA: After you wiped out the Eclipse, there were
hardly any priests or officers left to terrorise the little people.

237
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,165
UTHID: Avad offered amnesty to all
who were forced to serve the Shadow.

238
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:46,685
So the commoners cleaned out the citadel and handed it back to him.

239
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,671
The Sundom was unified.

240
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:52,558
VANASHA: Avad wanted Uthid to take command of the garrison there…

241
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,511
VANASHA: …but Captain cuddly here refused.

242
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:59,031
Rumour has it that he wanted to stay close to me here in Meridian.

243
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,717
UTHID: He he, that's nonsense of course.

244
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,072
ALOY: Well—
VANASHA: I know, I know, you're out.

245
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,857
Go! Away with you!

246
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,759
UTHID: Always an honour, Champion.

247
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,895
VANASHA: Always a pleasure.

248
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:16,432
But please, little huntress, come back someday?

249
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,567
And tell us about your adventures?

250
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:22,087
If I can't get in trouble, at least I can hear about yours.

251
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:33,499
GUARD: Saviour, welcome back to the Alight.

252
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,534
Well, that's everyone.

253
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,237
I guess it was nice to catch up.

254
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,339
For a little while.

255
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:50,232
Machine carcasses, remnants from the battle of the Alight.

256
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,536
"Honouring those who fell in the battle of the Alight."

257
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,223
Lots of brave people defended this place from Hades.

258
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,343
I guess I should be flattered by the statue.

259
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,146
It feels wrong.

260
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,249
Especially when my job is only half done.

261
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,641
I'd better get going.

262
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:55,047
And if I'm headed west, it sounds like I'll need
right of passage from the Tenakth as you said.

263
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,400
Where exactly is this Embassy going to be held?

264
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,638
MARAD: Past The Daunt, the canyon that marks
the western border of the Sundom.

265
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:06,158
You'll find the fortress of Barren Light at its farthest edge.

266
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,428
MARAD: The Embassy will take place just beyond its gates.

267
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,248
It's a long march, fortnight on foot.

268
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,051
VARL: A couple of day's hard riding should get us there.

269
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,856
ALOY: Actually, it might be better to rest here tonight.

270
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,241
Head out in the morning.

271
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,044
Of course. I'll arrange it.

272
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,489
[Song: In The Flood, by Oleksa Lozowchuk, feat. Ariana Gillis]

273
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,567
Am I the one to hold

274
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,270
This crown of ash and salt

275
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,941
Their kindness calls to me

276
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,277
I have to block it out

277
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:36,381
My voice has grown so somber

278
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,985
These words don't seem like mine

279
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,655
But the iron won't subside

280
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:50,078
No matter, no matter what I try

281
00:18:54,249 --> 00:19:00,906
Am I rain drops in the flood?

282
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,947
In this emptiness, in the storm

283
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:16,038
 If I falter, if I fall

284
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:23,846
The wave inside my soul carries all I know

285
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:31,486
Who can take my hand in the flood?

286
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,094
Her voice calls me forth

287
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,614
Through darkness unknown 

288
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,218
My heart with silence burns

289
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,155
Through solemness and bone

290
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,892
The edge beyond the shore

291
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,563
This weight of root and rot

292
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,166
I long to reach the other

293
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:08,473
To find, to find the path we lost

294
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:18,650
Am I rain drops in the flood?

295
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:26,692
In this emptiness, in the storm

296
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:33,782
If I'm broken, if I'm torn

297
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:41,590
The wave inside my soul carries all I know

298
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:55,087
Who can take my hand in the flood?

299
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,323
Sparks to steel!

300
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:21,830
Ha! Never seen anyone use one of those to get around.

301
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,651
Is that how I get to Barren Light?

302
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,370
Uh yes, I mean usually, but not today.

303
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,155
Not yet.

304
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,040
And why is that?

305
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:38,647
Well, The Daunt, the whole valley, it's infested with machines.

306
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,172
ALOY: I can handle machines.

307
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,874
Oh I'm sure you can, but…

308
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:54,646
I'm under strict orders not to operate until the whistle
down at Chainscrape sounds the all-clear.

309
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,752
Look, I didn't come all this way just to stand around and wait.

310
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,855
I'll crank that car down myself if I have to.

311
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,260
Well, but then who would crank it back up?

312
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,747
KARHN: Fine, fine.

313
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:27,946
Though, should anyone ask, it might be best to say you forced me.

314
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,556
ALOY: I see smoke, but not a lot of activity.

315
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,959
KARHN: Smoke's probably coming
from something the machines wrecked.

316
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:48,033
KARHN: As for the quiet, well,
there's a work stoppage in effect because of all the fuss.

317
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,353
ALOY: What sort of machines are causing the trouble?

318
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:56,358
KARHN: Nasty ones and lots of them. Bristlebacks, they're called.

319
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,328
KARHN: Strangeness is they're not native to The Daunt.

320
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,231
KARHN: Just showed up all of a sudden.

321
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,050
ALOY: No hunters to kill them?

322
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,135
KARHN: Well, we've got hunters. 

323
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,071
KARHN: Just none that want to cross Ulvund.

324
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:13,675
KARHN: Boss of Chainscrape, he is self-appointed.

325
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:16,161
KARHN: Work stoppage was his idea.

326
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,949
ALOY: Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.

327
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,768
ALOY: Got an embassy to attend.

328
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,020
KARHN: You should have said!

329
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,056
KARHN: That ain't gonna happen no time soon.

330
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,559
ALOY: What are you talking about?

331
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,629
KARHN: You hear that? That's your answer.

332
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,580
[distant raised voice] Not this time!

333
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,548
ALOY: Who is that?

334
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:42,871
KARHN: Carja Sun-Priest, cranked him down yesterday
about an hour before the machine trouble started.

335
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:45,807
KARHN: He's a very important man.

336
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:47,659
KARHN: Or so he says.

337
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,711
KARHN: That Embassy at Barren Light?

338
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,547
KARHN: He's the one supposed to run it! Hah!

339
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,050
ALOY: Great.

340
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,990
VUADIS: If you don't do as I say immediately,
the Sun-King himself shall hear of your insolence.

341
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,710
VUADIS: Thanks to you, I was forced to spend the night
shivering in the tent.

342
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,363
VUADIS:  Exposed to attack! I might have died.

343
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,234
VUADIS: Oh, me you refuse to transport, but not this …

344
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:18,723
VUADIS: This … what? This Nora girl? This savage?!

345
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,642
VUADIS: Aside, scallywag.

346
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,561
JORUF: Vuadis, that's Aloy.

347
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,646
VUADIS: Studious Vuadis.

348
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:27,549
JORUF: Aloy, you know, Saviour of Meridian.

349
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,950
VUADIS: Really?

350
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,039
VUADIS: Well, that lessens the insult, I suppose.

351
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,942
I came here for the Embassy at Barren Light.

352
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,527
Way I hear it, so did you.

353
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,214
VUADIS: Well, not with the valley infested.

354
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:52,707
"And so did Araman proclaim the Sun-Priests
most precious and worthy of safekeeping."

355
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,260
See? Scripture.

356
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:01,950
I shall head to Barren Light when the captain of the Vanguard
tells me the way is clear.

357
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,668
And not a moment sooner.

358
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,438
Fine.

359
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,157
Captain's a friend of mine, you know.

360
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,427
ALOY: Where is Erend?

361
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:16,198
Wouldn't mind speaking to someone a little more action, a little less …

362
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,566
… scroll.

363
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,719
JARUF: Vuadis—
VUADIS: Studious Vuadis.

364
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:26,691
Studious Vuadis sent Erend and another Vanguard
out at daybreak to clear the way.

365
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,810
VUADIS: "And so at daybreak—"
ALOY: Hey!

366
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
ALOY: Shh!

367
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,380
ALOY: Down the valley, then?

368
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,083
Yeah, said they'd check the ruins on the left bank for tracks.

369
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,134
Take it from there.

370
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,471
Okay. I hear there's a work stoppage.

371
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,039
Any way to upgrade my gear?

372
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,676
JORUF: I'll bet the smith in Chainscrape
would let you use his workbench.

373
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:49,047
As for the Bristlebacks, you might want to craft some acid arrows.

374
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,983
Hitting their canisters with those will take 'em down quick.

375
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:55,403
ALOY: Thanks. I'll find Erend and I'll bring him back.

376
00:25:58,757 --> 00:25:59,824
ALOY: Where do you think you're going?

377
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,245
VUADIS: Why, to the top of the ridge to wait in safety.

378
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,548
ALOY: Sorry, operator's under strict orders!

379
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,800
ALOY: No passengers till the whistle blows, right?

380
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,387
That's right. Best start cranking.

381
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,157
VUADIS: Why? Why?

382
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:20,378
ALOY: Joruf, would you kindly escort
Studious to Chainscrape and wait for me there?

383
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,947
JORUF: You got it.

384
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,101
I will find Erend and I will help clear a path.

385
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,421
But after that, no more excuses.

386
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,207
Barren Light. Embassy.

387
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,511
VUADIS: If such be the will of the Sun.

388
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,332
It will be, trust me.

389
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:51,876
I gotta find Erend, but it might be good
to hit Chainscrape first and upgrade my bow.

390
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:35,520
A gemstone. It's green like blaze, but it's hard and shiny.

391
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,206
Wonder if merchants would be interested?

392
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,329
It's a dead machine.

393
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,431
It must be a Bristleback.

394
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:23,518
Maybe Erend took it down?

395
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,438
Ground's soaked with acid.

396
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,741
Did the Bristlebacks do this?

397
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,436
That must be Chainscrape.

398
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,939
Joruf said I could get my bow upgraded in there.

399
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,226
Might be able to tinker with my other gear too.

400
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,833
OSERAM GUARD: Outlander approaching. Is that the Saviour?

401
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,835
OSERAM GUARD: Wanna come in Saviour?

402
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:23,895
Welcome to Chainscrape, Saviour.

403
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,981
Open up guys, Joruf's orders.

404
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,350
Good enough for me.

405
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,431
VOICE: By. The. Forge!

406
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,333
Petra?

407
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,035
Aloy! What are you doing here?

408
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,520
ALOY: Uhh…

409
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,707
PETRA: 'Bout time there was something worth looking at in this dump.

410
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:54,859
ALOY: It's nice to see you too.

411
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,095
PETRA: And not a moment too soon.

412
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:58,196
PETRA: Come on!

413
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:58,980
ALOY: I…

414
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,203
PETRA: Damn brewery's only thing I can count on in this place.

415
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,172
ALOY: Yeah, I heard. Machines. Work stoppage?

416
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,208
PETRA: Oh, those are just the latest malfunctions.

417
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,994
Chainscrape's always been a few tools short of a kit.

418
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,846
And right there is the biggest tool of all.

419
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,414
ULVUND: Not our land, not our problem.

420
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,099
JAVAD: The Bristlebacks are everybody's problem.

421
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:18,933
ALOY: Ulvund?

422
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,952
PETRA: You've heard of him?

423
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,637
ALOY: Yeah.

424
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:26,474
PETRA: But he's a story best told over a cold beer.

425
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,609
ALOY: Uh Petra! Petra!

426
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,696
I'm just passing through.

427
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,681
I'm headed west.

428
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,249
Oh.

429
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:39,253
There's an Embassy at Barren Light I need to make happen.

430
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:42,373
And then I… keep moving.

431
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,877
Ah, of course.

432
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,079
Bigger gears to grind.

433
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,333
Well, flamehair, good to see you.

434
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:54,802
If you gotta move on…

435
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,704
Petra.

436
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,326
But if you want a cold beer and a few laughs with an old friend?

437
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,712
Come find me at the brewery, your choice.

438
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,456
Well this Ulvund guy sounds like trouble.

439
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:18,426
Maybe Petra could use some support.

440
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,445
But first things first I need to find that workbench and upgrade my bow.

441
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:32,540
HAKUND: Until Ulvund blows that whistle, no-one's working here.

442
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,828
ALOY: Shop looks closed?

443
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:38,596
HAKUND: Yep.

444
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,681
ALOY: Can I still use the workbench?

445
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,783
HAKUND: I ain't gonna stop you.

446
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:50,091
HAKUND: Workbench is good for all kinds of tinkering.

447
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,509
This should be useful.

448
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:45,663
Now I just need to find Erend and help him clear the Bristlebacks.

449
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:23,911
Can't override that now. Need to get data
from a cauldron, if I can find one,.

450
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,356
Pain's subsiding.

451
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,351
I'll gather these while I can.

452
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,141
Acid won't make much of a dent.

453
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,023
Is that a tripwire?

454
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,409
This whole area is rigged with tripwires.

455
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:20,281
THURLIS: Hey! You! Make it worth your while
if you kill these Scroungers!

456
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:21,815
ALOY: It's always something.

457
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,402
ALOY: Hold tight! I'll see what I can do.

458
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,521
THURLIS: Try luring them into the tripwires.

459
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:00,287
THURLIS: That's fancy wire-work!

460
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,411
ALOY: That's the last one.

461
00:44:57,644 --> 00:45:00,731
THURLIS: Hello, Red. What a day. What a day.

462
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,938
THURLIS: Thank the Forge you showed up.

463
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,792
THURLIS: Tripwires are handy, but machine hunting's a young-uns game.

464
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,129
THURLIS: Come on over, let me give thanks proper like.

465
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:20,401
THURLIS: I see you're a practised hunter.

466
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:25,489
Took you less time to kill those Scroungers
than Vanguards to kill one Bristleback.

467
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,541
ALOY: So the Vanguards came through here?

468
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,960
THURLIS: Yeah, just a bit ago.

469
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,546
THURLIS: Downed that Bristleback, headed south.

470
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,851
THURLIS: But then those Scroungers showed up
to carve the carcass, as they do.

471
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,637
THURLIS: Then another Bristleback ran through.

472
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,357
I'm telling you, it's crazy around here.

473
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:45,426
So the Vanguard went south.

474
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:49,229
Probably. This whole valley is swarming with them.

475
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:51,782
THURLIS: The Vanguard seemed dead set on getting rid of them.

476
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,850
ALOY: I see.

477
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,651
Hold on there, Red.

478
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:59,056
If you're gonna go chasing across The Daunt,
you're gonna want a Tripcaster.

479
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:03,961
Not just any Tripcaster, one of my make, free of charge.

480
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,347
Workmanship looks solid enough.

481
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,515
THURLIS: Yup.

482
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,435
Been tweaking the design since I left Chainscrape.

483
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:17,508
More room to tinker out here and less chance of, well, accidents.

484
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,577
Did something happen in Chainscrape?

485
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,564
More like someone.

486
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:24,932
I don't follow.

487
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,485
There's this sack of wet dirt, Ulvund.

488
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,288
Thinks he's the Ealdorman of Chainscrape.

489
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,757
Got half the town treating him as such.

490
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:40,447
Back when I had a place in town, he took a real interest in my wares.

491
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,183
THURLIS: Kept pressing for the "Ulvund discount".

492
00:46:43,183 --> 00:46:46,553
THURLIS: I said no, he didn't like that so much.

493
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:52,142
THURLIS: I can't prove it, but that chuffbucket set my workshop on fire.

494
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,362
Felt it best to put some distance between us after that.

495
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:59,433
ALOY: Cable car operator told me
the Bristlebacks just appeared yesterday.

496
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,084
Do you know anything about them?

497
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,636
How is old Karhn?

498
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,123
Back in the day, me and him got into all sorts of trouble.

499
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,224
There was this one time tha—

500
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,343
ALOY: Anything about the Bristlebacks?

501
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:11,762
Nope, Karhn said true.

502
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,364
Just showed up and ran amok.

503
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:19,436
Lucky for me, I've got you and the Vanguard
swooping in time to time to save my backside.

504
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,138
ALOY: I should get going.

505
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,690
Thanks for the Tripcaster.

506
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:28,478
While you're blasting Bristlebacks,
I think I'll head down to the hunting grounds.

507
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:31,465
Did you know they have a Tripcaster trial?

508
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,834
Come by later, if you want to try it out.

509
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,638
ALOY: Maybe, after I get things under control.

510
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,607
ALOY: So Erend headed south.

511
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,176
Should be able to pick up his tracks with my Focus.

512
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,853
Tracks. Maybe Erend's and the Vanguards'.

513
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,178
It's a ruin from the Old World.

514
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,264
Bet I could find something interesting inside.

515
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,805
FENDUR: Hey you! Mind giving me a hand?

516
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,691
TELGA: Is that the Saviour of Meridian?

517
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,225
FENDUR: Welcome to the party!

518
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,560
ALOY: Glad I can help.

519
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,332
TELGA: Big guy's fast!

520
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,338
TELGA: Try pushing it off.

521
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,854
Mighty thankful to you, Saviour.

522
00:50:07,854 --> 00:50:10,440
Just Aloy is fine.

523
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,043
Erend mentioned you're not one for fancy titles.

524
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,127
You're Vanguard.

525
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:17,497
FENDUR: We're here to escort Vuadis' delicate behind to the Embassy.

526
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:20,350
TELGA: If we can get rid of these Bristlebacks.

527
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,769
FENDUR: Captain said to keep an eye on Chainscrape.

528
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,588
Then these ugly lugs showed up.

529
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,089
TELGA: Gave the first one a good beating.

530
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,259
FENDUR: But didn't quite have time to roll out of the way when it fell.

531
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,529
Told you it wasn't a good idea to eat that much before heading out.

532
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,282
ALOY: I should probably get going.

533
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,652
FENDUR: Now, if you see any more of these Bristlebacks…

534
00:50:38,652 --> 00:50:41,021
ALOY: I'll make sure to roll out of their way.

535
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:43,356
TELGA: Might want to take some of these with you as well.

536
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:45,142
They're handy in a pinch.

537
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,743
Thanks.

538
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:48,328
TELGA: Stay safe, Aloy.
