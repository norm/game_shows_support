1
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,263
The first report of them came from west of the quarry.

2
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:38,621
According to one terrified labourer,
said the ground trembled before they came charging down the hillside.

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,875
He took off and ran all the way here.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,529
But unless they have wings I don't know about,
I don't see how they could have come over the mountains.

5
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,799
PETRA: A Stormbird crashed up on the cliffs last week.

6
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,570
PETRA: And Tolland Cleanbroker's had his eye on the salvage ever since.

7
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,638
PETRA: But the refugees have barred entrance.

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,324
PETRA: Mustn't interrupt their sun-scorched ritual.

9
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,560
PETRA: Something about finding a "twilight path".

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,613
ALOY: Huh, never heard them talk about that before.

11
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:07,333
PETRA: Yeah, well, these particular Shadow Carja are an odd bunch.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,404
PETRA: But overall they're peaceful folk, not that it matters to Tolland.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,775
ODURG: Well fought friend, well fought.

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,727
Are you okay?

15
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:20,046
ODURG: [laughing] Yeah. Oof.

16
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:24,033
ODURG: Serves me right for thinking I could go up
against the Saviour of Meridian.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,571
Here, have this. A little something for the new champion.

18
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,623
Thank you, Odurg.

19
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:35,428
Don't be a stranger now.
Come back whenever you'd like to spar again.

20
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:37,213
ALOY: I should go.

21
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,178
DELAH: I'm sorry, I'll be right with you.

22
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,229
ALOY: Uhhh…

23
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,415
DELAH: Okay, I'm not saying it's a bad idea,
I'm saying it's overkill.

24
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,885
BOOMER: It's a weapon! Kill is the point!

25
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,003
DELHA: Not if it blows the user's arm off!

26
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,990
DELAH: Tch–tch–tch just stop talking.

27
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,109
DELAH: Where were we? Ah!

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,813
DELAH: [clears throat] So … ah … you!

29
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:47,717
DELAH: You look like someone who's always
searching for a new weapon.

30
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:48,852
DELAH: Am I right?

31
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,587
Actually, I– oh!

32
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,175
DELAH: Could you just not?! I am with a customer.

33
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,759
I'm not a customer.

34
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,728
BOOMER: I got it! Triple the powder.

35
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,997
It'll blow a Strider sky high, ba-boom!

36
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:01,447
It'll blow a Strider sky high, ba-boom!

37
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,416
BOOMER: One shot kill, guaranteed.

38
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,735
ALOY: Um, maybe I am.

39
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,356
DELAH: Then you are in the right place at the right time, Red.

40
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,727
DELAH: How would you like to be the proud owner
of the world's first machine enhanced—

41
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,813
BOOMER: —explosive, done in one, machine wrecking—

42
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,884
DELAH: —yet perfectly safe javelin thrower?

43
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,152
Are you two from around here?

44
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:28,541
Nah, the Claim. Dad sent us out west
in search of some unknown opportunity.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,126
Said we'll know it when we see it.

46
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,161
Sounds like you had other ideas.

47
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:38,184
Let's just say that opening another trading post for my parents
isn't how I want to make my mark in this world.

48
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:43,089
DELAH: [sighs] I imagine travelling alone must be nice.

49
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,008
ALOY: So she's your partner?

50
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,111
DELAH: My apprentice … and my sister.

51
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,913
She's why we're out here.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,181
There was was an incident … 

53
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,117
ALOY: Involving explosives?

54
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:55,001
BOOMER: Ba-boom!

55
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,470
DELAH: …and Dad's precious homebrew.

56
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,138
He shipped us out the next day.

57
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,173
ALOY: Huh.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,662
Saw a scroll when I was a kid
by some Carja scholar who wandered out west.

59
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,900
Had a scary drawing of a Tenakth warrior
hunting with a kind of javelin thrower.

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,954
DELAH: Effective? Yes. Basic? Undoubtedly.

61
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,024
But coming out here made me remember it.

62
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,811
And I am on the brink of vastly improving the tool's archaic design.

63
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,130
BOOMER: Whereas I will perfect it.

64
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,167
I can use machine parts to enhance the user's throw,
increase the projectile's velocity.

65
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,654
While Boomer here is adamant that enhancing the projectile is better.

66
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,923
DELAH: Namely with explosive tips.

67
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,124
BOOMER: Boomsticks!

68
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,210
ALOY: Why not both?

69
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,315
That … could work.

70
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,985
There's one small snag, I need the parts
to make the first working model.

71
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,721
BOOMER: Charger horns, intact.

72
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,590
Yeah, that.

73
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,978
Just be sure to shoot them off
before the machine goes down, otherwise they break.

74
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,348
But the real innovation is a Fanghorn rib.

75
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,901
BOOMER: There's a mean one east of here, blow it sky-high!

76
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,403
DELAH: Boomer!

77
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,089
You get them for me, it's yours, my treat.

78
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,507
You have a deal.

79
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,851
Boomer said that Fanghorn should be nearby.

80
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,494
There's the Fanghorn. Gonna have to take it down to get its rib.

81
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:03,082
Down it goes! Should be able to harvest its rib now.

82
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:10,256
Got the Fanghorn rib, now I just need the Charger horns.

83
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,401
There goes a horn!

84
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,019
Got everything I need for Delah and Boomer.

85
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,889
Now to see about that weapon of theirs.

86
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,991
Javad said the Bristlebacks were first spotted west of the quarry.

87
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,994
I should see if there's anything in the back of the valley.

88
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,489
Dead Bristleback, by the falls.

89
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,391
Better check it out.

90
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,788
That's strange. Parts of it have been tampered with.

91
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,691
Almost like an override.

92
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,001
Looks like it died on impact.

93
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,488
Maybe it charged off the cliff up there?

94
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,291
I'd better keep following the trail up.

95
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,801
An old mine.

96
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,588
And a lot of broken trees.

97
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,507
It's like a stampede went through.

98
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,793
Is this where the Bristlebacks came from?

99
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:31,280
But … how?

100
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,682
Unless… 

101
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,885
This cave leads out of The Daunt?

102
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:02,645
Okay, let's see where this leads.

103
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,192
The old car tracks collapsed.

104
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,394
It looks recent.

105
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,613
Guess I'm not going that way.

106
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,879
There's smoke from deeper in the mine. An explosion?

107
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,166
Bristlebacks! I guess they got trapped here.

108
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,102
I'm gonna have to take them out before I can look around.

109
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,327
sometimes.

110
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,934
Okay, better take a look at where the smoke is coming from.

111
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,835
There's a lot of smoke.

112
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,721
It looks like the mine runs pretty far back.

113
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,926
[coughing] It's a dead end.

114
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,929
Bristlebacks must have collapsed these tracks, too.

115
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,143
That is a lot of blaze down there.

116
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,337
There's enough blaze here to blast a mountain open.

117
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,023
And there's a note on one of the barrels.

118
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,512
This note's addressed to Ulvund.

119
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,134
Looks like this mine was supposed to be shut down.

120
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,789
Ulvund must've gotten greedy,
kept blasting deeper into the mountain.

121
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,724
I should let Javad know what I've found.

122
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:13,105
So Ulvund was secretly blasting in the mine,
trying to squeeze it for all it's worth.

123
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,775
Until Bristlebacks stampeded through.

124
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,131
Maybe the explosions blew a way open? But from where?

125
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,451
LUF: It's not looking good, folks!

126
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,123
LUF: Oof! Them Shadow Carja are taking a beating!

127
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,829
ALOY: Those people are under attack.

128
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,033
ALOY: Hey, you up there! Aren't you gonna help?

129
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:10,505
LUF: Not my job. I'm just here
to keep an eye on things for Chainscrape.

130
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,526
LUF: Might as well call it quits!

131
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,607
Move.

132
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,458
LOKASHA: More machines on their way.

133
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,144
LUF: Oh! That's a nasty one.

134
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,519
CARJA: Go Lokasha, I'll help the Nora.

135
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:21,126
That's the last of them.

136
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:23,128
Better check on the refugees.

137
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:26,198
CARJA: Is it bad Lokasha?

138
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:30,035
LOKASHA: Ssh now, everything will be fine.

139
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,636
Is everyone ok?

140
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,140
Bruised but not buried.

141
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,177
LOKASHA: Our order will live to see another day.

142
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,812
ALOY: Are you sure about that?

143
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,817
LOKASHA: We're no strangers to hardship, Nora.

144
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,205
LOKASHA: We've crossed half the Sundom
with no more than the clothes on our backs.

145
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:55,393
LOKASHA: And as soon as our Sun-Priest returns,
our path will be clear.

146
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,146
LOKASHA: For now, we wait.

147
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,782
ALOY: Well, you're better off waiting somewhere else.

148
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:03,118
ALOY: Your people need shelter. There's a town east—

149
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:06,621
LOKASHA: Chainscrape. Yes, we know of it.

150
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,342
Savohar says it's not suitable for us.

151
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,226
ALOY: Who?

152
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,911
LOKASHA: Our Sun-Priest.

153
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:18,333
LOKASHA: Our order has made it this far thanks to his guiding light.

154
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,770
ALOY: Okay, and where is this Savohar?

155
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:25,824
He went up to the tower to meditate three days ago.

156
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,711
LOKASHA: And he won't come down until the Sun
shows him the way to our new home.

157
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,714
LOKASHA: The fallen Stormbird is an omen, he said.

158
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,317
ALOY: And how long do you plan on waiting for him?

159
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,452
LOKASHA: Until he returns.

160
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,722
LOKASHA: He will return.

161
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,825
ALOY: You're Shadow Carja, aren't you?

162
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,711
We are the Order of Twilight.

163
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,380
ALOY: The difference being?

164
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,419
When the usurper Avad killed his father,
we fled with the Carja in Shadow to Sunfall.

165
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,923
Our lives there were difficult.

166
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,410
Savohar saw our misery, lifted us up.

167
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,464
Protected us from the corrupt priests and heartless kestrels.

168
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:11,336
LOKASHA: When their rule ended,
Savohar led us from the shadowlands.

169
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:18,977
"The long night ends and the setting sun
will lead us to salvation," he said.

170
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,731
And so he named us the Order of Twilight.

171
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,134
LOKASHA: We journeyed west in search of a better life.

172
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,203
ALOY: Why didn't you go back to Meridian?

173
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:33,308
Avad is a patricide! We will not kneel to the likes of him.

174
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,581
We must walk in twilight to our new home.

175
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,134
ALOY: But shelter looks like a more pressing concern.

176
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,856
LOKASHA: His meditation can't be rushed.

177
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,893
ALOY: So he does this often, meditating for days on end?

178
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,047
Well, it doesn't usually take this long.

179
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,834
But he will guide us through.

180
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:01,970
He always has.

181
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,557
We have faith.

182
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,526
ALOY: There's an Oseram in Chainscrape, Tolland.

183
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,729
He wants the Stormbird up there.

184
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:14,032
Yes, he was here just yesterday.

185
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:18,787
A very unpleasant man, even by Oseram standards.

186
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,756
He made all manner of threats.

187
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,644
But we will not be intimidated.

188
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,763
That's all well and good, but he's got friends.

189
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,433
ALOY: Sooner or later, his whole gang will show up.

190
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:31,533
LOKASHA: Savohar will come through, he always does.

191
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:35,337
LOKASHA: Savohar will come through, he always does.

192
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:37,739
LOKASHA: We just need to give him more time.

193
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,874
ALOY: You're out of time, Lokasha!

194
00:27:39,874 --> 00:27:41,359
ALOY: You need to consider packing up and—

195
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,461
LOKASHA: We won't leave him.

196
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:47,148
And we won't let others disrupt his meditation.

197
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:49,467
ALOY: Well, they're going to try.

198
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,737
ALOY: You're in danger here.

199
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,557
ALOY: You need to grab Savohar and get out.

200
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:08,319
Our situation … this is the worst we've endured.

201
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:13,508
LOKASHA: I know we cannot stay here,
but without Savohar to guide us I don't …

202
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:18,263
ALOY: Let me up there and I'll convince him it's time to move on.

203
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:23,468
But his meditation, if he hasn't received his vision, he won't follow.

204
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,387
At least let me check on him.

205
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,089
If he's been up there for days …

206
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,577
LOKASHA: Yes. Yes, that is sensible I suppose.

207
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,930
Please be careful.

208
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,450
LOKASHA: The trail up to the tower is falling apart.

209
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,704
Savohar is strong, but it could not have been an easy climb.

210
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,440
ALOY: It rarely is.

211
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,256
I should climb that.

212
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:50,155
Part of the ladder. Lokasha was right, the trail's in bad shape.

213
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,977
I think I can reach those beams if I jump against the cliff.

214
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:32,564
Okay, now how to climb higher?

215
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,670
Ladder must have broken off after Savohar passed through.

216
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:58,456
I need to find another way up.

217
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,467
Broken bridge.

218
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,054
I might be able to make the jump to the other side.

219
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:02,153
That's a lot of blood.

220
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,055
Savohar's?

221
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,662
He must have hurt himself pretty bad getting over the bridge.

222
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,714
It's not looking good.

223
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:15,266
It looks like he left a trail.

224
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,268
I can follow it with my Focus.

225
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:40,475
There's the Stormbird. Getting closer.

226
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:51,669
Machines. Savohar must have snuck past them.

227
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,866
I could probably slip past them.

228
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,870
Or take them out.

229
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:46,641
Yeah, yeah,

230
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,360
yeah, yeah

231
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,158
 That's all of them.

232
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,213
ALOY: There's Savohar, in pretty bad shape.

233
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,867
SAVOHAR: The true Sun before me.

234
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,953
SAVOHAR: Show me the way this eventide.

235
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,890
SAVOHAR: The true Sun above me.

236
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,492
ALOY: You must be Savohar.

237
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,761
SAVOHAR: The true Sun before me.

238
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:36,847
SAVOHAR: Show me the way this eventide.

239
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,257
No! No!

240
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:51,362
The vessel must be empty for the coming vision.

241
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,182
You don't need a vision, you need medical attention.

242
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:59,754
On the way up, I saw parts of the trail had given way.

243
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,739
ALOY: Is that how you hurt yourself?

244
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:08,045
My pain … all part of … the ritual.

245
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:13,434
You're hurt, bad, and your people are running out of time

246
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,937
Staring at the Stormbird isn't solving anything.

247
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:19,890
SAVOHAR: You don't understand the omen.

248
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:25,346
It fell … here … at the peak.

249
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,117
SAVOHAR: I just need to see the twilight path.

250
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:34,989
My people will find their home.

251
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:42,963
Listen, Lokasha is doing the best she can down there, but…

252
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,300
Machine attacks. Angry Oseram.

253
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,804
The order is scared, Savohar.

254
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:57,094
The last rays of the eventide will burn away their fear.

255
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,215
ALOY: What do you think is going to happen here?

256
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:05,002
If you sit long enough, the sun will show you something?

257
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,090
The path to a new home.

258
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:14,211
The fallen machine can only mean that…

259
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,331
…the storm has passed.

260
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:24,572
Our … salvation is at hand.

261
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:28,492
[sighs] Or some Oseram shot it and it hit an old tower.

262
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:39,236
The Sun will provide and I will not lose faith.

263
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:41,455
I'd be more concerned about losing blood.

264
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,708
ALOY: Look, I think you punctured a lung.

265
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,077
You can't heal it with prayer.

266
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,933
SAVOHAR: —Sun before me, show me the way this eventide.

267
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:55,986
ALOY: I think you've been staring at your salvation this whole time.

268
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,889
SAVOHAR: The true Sun above me,

269
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,224
SAVOHAR: The true Sun before me,

270
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:05,846
SAVOHAR: Show me the way this eventide.

271
00:41:20,528 --> 00:41:25,249
That Stormbird heart is valuable,
enough to feed all the refugees waiting below.

272
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,352
And his answer is sunstroke and a prayer? 

273
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:32,506
Why does every priest I meet think
blind faith is the answer to everything?

274
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,433
The Oseram that was watching the refugees
probably want to get Tolland.

275
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:19,720
I gotta get them out of here before he comes back.

276
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,720
There, the order should be able to afford shelter with this heart.

277
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:39,423
Some food and a change of clothes wouldn't hurt either.

278
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,732
Savohar?! How you holding up?

279
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,468
I need to get back over there.

280
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,028
I guess you did the best you could.

281
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,830
Rest easy now.

282
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,833
I'll make sure your people are safe.

283
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:45,689
I should let Lokasha know.

284
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,641
And give her the Stormbird heart.

285
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,513
LUF: Come on, don't make this difficult.

286
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,966
LUF: Get out of the way.

287
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,367
LOKASHA: No!

288
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,372
There's Tolland with his thugs.

289
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,641
LOKASHA: We will not yield.

290
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,427
We won't let you pass Oseram.

291
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,346
TOLLAND: I'm a generous gent.

292
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:48,369
TOLLAND: So I'll give you one more chance
to make it easy on yourselves and clear out.

293
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:51,188
LOKASHA: If you choose bloodshed, that's on your conscience.

294
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:55,125
Ain't it just like the Carja to make things harder than they have to be.

295
00:44:55,793 --> 00:45:00,330
TOLLAND: Okay boys, you heard her. Get your "consciences" ready.

296
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,832
ALOY: Hold on now, Tolland.

297
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,217
You again?

298
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,719
TOLLAND: Listen, I'm all out of patience here.

299
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:08,138
TOLLAND: I clipped that Stormbird's wings.

300
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,606
TOLLAND: The salvage is mine!

301
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,291
I don't care who gets in my way.

302
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,279
Nora savages or Shadow Carja fleabags, I'm taking it.

303
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,581
You sure you want to do that, Tolland?

304
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,483
You know who I am.

305
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,886
What makes you think a single Oseram lunkhead can take me down?

306
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:24,722
I've got four guys!

307
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,473
I've got four guys, huh?

308
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:32,846
ALOY: From what I hear,
the law says that whoever gets the salvage first keeps it.

309
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,532
ALOY: Which in this case is me.

310
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,366
ALOY: Am I right?

311
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,951
You took the heart?!

312
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,587
I shot that Stormbird, me!

313
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:41,705
Am I right?

314
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,040
LUF: She's right, boss.

315
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,758
TOLLAND: Blast it, Luf, shut up!

316
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,046
ALOY: Might be hard to swallow,
but it's time to cut your losses, don't you think?

317
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,149
LUF: Come on, boss, it's not worth it.

318
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,855
TOLLAND: Okay, you win.

319
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:02,259
TOLLAND: Hey, I'm doing fine. I don't need that salvage anyhow.

320
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:07,631
TOLLAND: But these "people" need all the help they can get.

321
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,633
TOLLAND: Come on, boys. Back to Chainscrape.

322
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,353
TOLLAND: Back to Chainscrape. I need a drink.

323
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,327
LOKASHA: Again we thank you.

324
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,545
ALOY: You're welcome.

325
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,047
Now take this heart.

326
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:28,268
Use it to buy food, clothes, shelter for your people.

327
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,854
Maybe even land to build a new home.

328
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,824
LOKASHA: Savohar must make these decisions.

329
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:37,077
No, I'm–I'm sorry, Lokasha.

330
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,897
Savohar isn't coming back.

331
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,899
He's gone.

332
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:49,289
ALOY: I know it's hard, but your people need a leader now.

333
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:54,795
ALOY: Go to Chainscrape, talk to the forgewoman there, Petra.

334
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:56,480
Give her the Stormbird heart.

335
00:46:57,164 --> 00:47:01,001
She'll look after you and your people
until you can get back on your feet.

336
00:47:01,468 --> 00:47:02,986
Find your path.

337
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,472
LOKASHA: I'll do my best, Aloy.

338
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,175
