1
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,660
What's that now, don't like the cold?

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
Can't stay in today.
We have a ritual to perform you and I.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,600
[gurgling]

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
Here.

5
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,900
Wear this.

6
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,440
It belonged to my daughter.

7
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
Good.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,320
Today I speak your name girl.

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,160
But will the Goddess speak it back?

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,540
Normally it would be the mother who declares...

11
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,100
...if you had one.

12
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,220
The whole village would attend
and Matriarchs perform the ritual.

13
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,920
But we are outcasts.

14
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,880
Even so, we keep the tribe's rituals.

15
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,020
Otherwise we might become like the faithless
Old Ones

16
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,799
who turned their backs on the Goddess.

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,130
But their wickedness doomed them.

18
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,180
To us, were left the splendours of creation.

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,160
Beasts of air, water, earth...

20
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
...and steel.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,340
[roaring]

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,720
It is one thing to hunt a beast,
another to hunt a machine.

23
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,100
You must be humble and respect their power.

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,240
I will teach you this, one day.

25
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,960
High Matriarch Teersa.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,980
What is she doing here?

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,340
Does she mean to forbid the ritual?

28
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
No, no, no, off your knees.

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
It's nearly time.

30
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,700
And yes, you may speak to me.

31
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,780
You came to bless the naming?

32
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,440
Have not six months gone by
since we entrusted her to you?

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,380
But we are outcasts.

34
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,360
You by choice, and she...
...well...

35
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,600
I am a High Matriarch Rost.

36
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,260
I bless whom I choose.

37
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,960
Then you honour us?

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,420
Yes, yes, now go, and be ready to declare.

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,140
Go!

40
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,519
All-Mother this child needs a name by which
to know her.

41
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,360
That your love may warm her life
as the rising sun warms all the earth.

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,380
Speak her name!

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,640
ALOY!
 [echoes] aloy … aloy … aloy

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
And so her name is blessed.

45
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,200
Stop this at once!

46
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,240
What have you done?

47
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,790
I've blessed the naming of a child.

48
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,000
Stubborn woman, you call that curse a child?

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,160
What did she tell you about its birth Outcast?

50
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
Answer!

51
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,330
I've done only what you asked.

52
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,340
To raise it yes.

53
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,190
We said nothing of love.

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,190
Enough!

55
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,820
And you, blessing its name like it was one
of the Nora, one of the tribe!

56
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,060
I know my duty to them, and to you.

57
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,220
I'm here.

58
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,000
And wherever you go I will follow.

59
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580
[offscreen] Aloy! Aloy!

60
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,260
Ooh, that's a lot of berries.

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,020
You're quite the gatherer aren't you little
Bast?

62
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,440
Now go and see if you can find some more,
hmm?

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Well done, that's a good boy.

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Children, come with me.

65
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,560
She's an outcast, to be shunned.

66
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, come on… there.

67
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,080
[cries]

68
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,640
[grunting]

69
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,860
[coughing]

70
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Rost!

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
Down here!

72
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,120
Rost!

73
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,380
Rost!

74
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,880
He won't hear me.

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,460
Some kind of cave?

76
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,040
Ugh, there are rats down here.

77
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,980
Looks tight, but I can get through.

78
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,540
This must be a ruin of the Metal World.

79
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,000
One of the old places.

80
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,000
Rost said never go in places like this.

81
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,840
But I have to find a way out.

82
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,640
There's something up ahead.

83
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,240
What's that?

84
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,640
A dead person!

85
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,200
There's something shiny there?

86
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,380
Oh!

87
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,400
Lights!

88
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,580
Everywhere!

89
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,260
How does it do this?

90
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,160
A metal door, closed.

91
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,920
Maybe this device I've found can help?

92
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,780
More lights!

93
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,440
A shape, its connected to the door somehow.

94
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,940
It changed colour.

95
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
The door changed colour too!

96
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,100
It did it!

97
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,160
What's that?

98
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,220
It's got a device, like the one I found.

99
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,720
You think I want it this way? ->

100
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,340
It's the best I can do.

101
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,760
He's right behind you.

102
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Hi!

103
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,140
Happy birthday Isaac!

104
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,900
Daddy sure does love his little big man!

105
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,220
Look, Daddy can't be there with you and Mom

106
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,280
but we can still have a party, right?

107
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
Sure we can!

108
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Show me!

109
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,740
Show me again!

110
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,800
…I can do.

111
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
He's right behind you.

112
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Hi!

113
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,140
Happy birthday Isaac!

114
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,420
Daddy sure does love his little big man!

115
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,260
Look, Daddy can't be there with you and Mom

116
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,920
but we can still have a party, right?

117
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,520
Sure we can!

118
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,820
"Happy birthday Isaac."

119
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
"Daddy sure does love his little big man."

120
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,380
I saw them lining up in the community room

121
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,020
like cattle in a slaughterhouse,

122
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,740
but smiling at each other

123
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,560
Chana handing out meds like being alive

124
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,740
is some kind of... pain to be eased

125
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,100
Well, not me.

126
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,559
I don't want to go quiet.

127
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,460
I don't want to trail off.

128
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,640
I want a period at the end
of my life sentence,

129
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,540
not an ellipsis.

130
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,960
Hell, an exclamation mark.

131
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,060
So if that upsets whoever finds this, too
bad.

132
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't owe anyone anything anymore.

133
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,560
[gunshot]

134
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,920
Well happy new year, dear diary.

135
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,820
Can you believe we actually celebrated last
night?

136
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,700
Well, we did.

137
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,960
Kind of.

138
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,940
Director Evans invited everyone to gather
in the community room.

139
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,360
Don't know where she got the party hats.

140
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,100
That was a ghoulish touch.

141
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,020
So there we sit,
watching the clock tick down to midnight,

142
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,030
and I'm thinking am I the only one here
who gets the symbolism of this?

143
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,780
Might've been worth it if Skylar
had gotten drunk again,

144
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,400
but I seem to be a mistake
she doesn't want to repeat.

145
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,620
Why did they die here?

146
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,200
What happened to them?

147
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
…and pray for us sinners now

148
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,560
and at the hour of our debt.

149
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,780
I mean death.

150
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Sorry.

151
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,420
It's been a while and these meds
Chana gave us are really something.

152
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,040
So.

153
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Okay.

154
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,780
From the top, kids.

155
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,080
Hail Mary, full of grace...

156
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,440
And maybe that's all I need, you know?

157
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,980
That moment the door opened
and you were standing there,

158
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,500
wearing that retro-weave dress
and the way you smiled.

159
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,520
I had to look away or you were going to see

160
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,140
on my face

161
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,200
What had just...

162
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,500
…blossomed inside me, you know?

163
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
It was just an instant, but I knew.

164
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,680
I knew we'd be forever.

165
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,260
"The earth shall soon dissolve like snow"

166
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,500
"The sun forbear to shine"

167
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,420
"But God, who called me here below"

168
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,520
"Will be forever mine"

169
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,120
And Machu Picchu.

170
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,300
Always wanted to see that.

171
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,840
Never did.

172
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,640
Why didn't I go with Owen when he asked?

173
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,820
Stupid.

174
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,740
I should have gone.

175
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Well.

176
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,380
I mean, seriously,
"Record our thoughts for posterity"?

177
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,820
Great idea, Director Evans.

178
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,080
Like I haven't done enough for posterity already?

179
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,980
Like I wouldn't be here like this if not for
posterity?

180
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm done with posterity.

181
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,700
Posterity can go f…

182
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,880
[in the distance]
Aloy! Aloy!

183
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
[in the distance]
Are you down there?

184
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,700
He found me!

185
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,280
Rost found me.

186
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,880
Down here, I'm coming, I'm coming.

187
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,240
All-Mother be praised!

188
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,120
Come girl, take my hand.

189
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,520
You don't belong down there, come.

190
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Such places are forbidden Aloy.

191
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,520
I fell in.

192
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,320
They are of the Metal World.

193
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,780
What is that on your face?

194
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Nothing.

195
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,380
Did you find it down there?

196
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,260
No.

197
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,820
Give it to me.

198
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,740
No.

199
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,160
Aloy, such things are dangerous.

200
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,700
No!

201
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,360
Well, if you are going to go sneaking away
from home

202
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,340
you need to know how to survive in the wild.

203
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,760
Come Aloy, home now.

204
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,500
Starting tomorrow you will learn to hunt.

205
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,600
All these shapes what do they mean?

206
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,220
Take your bow.

207
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,820
"Bow"?

208
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,620
And enough muttering to that plaything.

209
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,700
We descend to the valley now.

210
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,320
Follow.

211
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,860
The wilds can be dangerous, Aloy.

212
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,220
You will need to stay close and do as I say.

213
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
I know.

214
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,260
Now, you're still scratched up
from that fall you took yesterday.

215
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,590
So let's start there.

216
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,830
Take this medicine pouch.

217
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll show you how to fill it.

218
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,340
You see this plant over here?

219
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,910
It's called "salvebrush".

220
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,940
Come, gather its berries in your pouch.

221
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,960
Good, now eat the berries.

222
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,240
Bleah!

223
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,440
They may taste bitter
but they can save your life.

224
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,870
Always keep your pouch full
of medicinal berries, flowers, and plants.

225
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,080
Where are we?

226
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,180
This valley is just a part of All-Mother's
Embrace.

227
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,700
"Embrace"

228
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,420
The Nora Tribe watches these lands

229
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,580
and keeps out the most dangerous machines.

230
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,000
Usually.

231
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,822
Further downriver we'll find a herd of machines

232
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:12,860
and I will teach you how to hunt.

233
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,010
Are they dangerous?

234
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,400
All machines are dangerous, Aloy.

235
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,370
Their power must be respected.

236
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,880
But I will be beside you.

237
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,740
Aloy, a machine is coming.

238
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,720
Crouch and follow me into the tall grass.

239
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,880
There.

240
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,240
Now stay low.

241
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,460
Little ones!

242
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,679
No, Aloy.

243
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Such machines are called Watchers.

244
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,200
You must learn to avoid their gaze
if you are to survive in the wilds.

245
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,560
I will show you.

246
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,280
Listen closely, and do as I do.

247
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,180
Stay still and wait for it to pass.

248
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,520
Now keep low and follow me
across the trail to that tall grass.

249
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,140
Ho, another one, let it pass.

250
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,460
Come, back this way.

251
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,880
The slower you move, the quieter you will
be.

252
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,460
And crouched walking is quieter than upright.

253
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,860
Wait for it.

254
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,400
That's the last of them.

255
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,540
Let's move on.

256
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,460
You did well, they didn't see or hear you.

257
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,400
Now stay close, that herd should be just ahead.

258
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,740
Who's that?

259
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,540
Ignore him.

260
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,740
But why is he up there?

261
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,281
He's smiling at us!

262
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:53,040
[offscreen]
Teb, get back where you belong.

263
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,020
[offscreen]
Teb! Where are you?

264
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,020
Ignore him.

265
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,580
We are outcasts and he is of the tribe.

266
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,620
Maybe he doesn't like the tribe?

267
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,300
Then he is a fool.

268
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,020
Come now, let's find that herd.

269
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,940
Follow.

270
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,140
There, see them?

271
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,240
These are called Striders.

272
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,340
HA! GIT!

273
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,940
Why'd you chase them off?

274
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,819
To show you how some machines startle easily
if they detect you, and run away.

275
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:11,069
They're best approached by stealth.

276
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,860
Don't worry, we'll catch up with them
further down the valley, you'll see.

277
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,860
Now, I want you to find some rocks
that fit the cup of your hand.

278
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:24,869
Why?

279
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,710
Do as I say Aloy and gather the rocks.

280
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,420
I will show you how to use them.

281
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,140
Good, that's it.

282
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,900
Those will do.

283
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,040
Follow.

284
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,940
There's the herd.

285
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,520
Alright, it's time to throw some rocks.

286
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:15,019
But rocks can't hurt machines, right?

287
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,630
No, but they can distract them.

288
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,099
Draw them into traps.

289
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,950
Like that Watcher over there.

290
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,600
They must be dealt with or it will
warn the herd

291
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,500
and send them running before we get in range.

292
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,000
Warn them? How?

293
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,819
The machines speak to each other, Aloy.

294
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,440
Unless they are first silenced.

295
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,339
Now you stay here on the ridge.

296
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,729
On my signal, throw rocks
and draw the Watcher over to me.

297
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,580
Wait for my signal.

298
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,180
Aloy!

299
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,380
Throw a rock near me.

300
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,060
There.

301
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,960
Come girl, it's safe now.

302
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,000
Harvest the kill so I can teach you
how to make arrows.

303
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
Good.

304
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,400
Now, gather stalks of Ridge-Wood
from the plants over there.

305
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,060
Use the stalks as arrow shafts
and metal shards for arrow heads.

306
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,660
Good.

307
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,080
You'll never run out of arrows
if you know how to craft what you need.

308
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,460
Let's put those arrows to use.

309
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,580
Follow.

310
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,540
Here. Stay low in the grass and be quiet.

311
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,400
It's time to make your first kill, Aloy.

312
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,200
Strider.

313
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,980
One of the weaker machines.

314
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,060
But even a weak machine can
kill a hunter if she's careless.

315
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,140
You must study your prey.

316
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:59,100
It's hide is thick but there are spots
where it is vulnerable, like its eye.

317
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,860
Can you guess another?

318
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,740
The canister on its back.

319
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,540
Is that a weakness?

320
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes, how did you guess that?

321
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,820
The device, it showed me.

322
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:52,249
That plaything?

323
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:53,700
Stop playing games.

324
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,489
Now, take down that Strider.

325
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:58,109
Target the eye or the canister.

326
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:02,160
And if it charges,
be ready to roll out of the way.

327
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,220
Keep firing!

328
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,260
Again!

329
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,900
You did well today but you have much to learn.

330
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,960
Tomorrow we train again.

331
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,840
[yelling] →

332
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,960
What was that?

333
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,460
That boy, the one running the Brave Trails.

334
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,780
Follow Aloy, quick!

335
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,560
[grunting]

336
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,240
[scream]

337
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,800
I can do nothing.

338
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,580
It is only a matter of time before the machines

339
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,920
find that boy and kick him to death.

340
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,600
But if I shoot it would cause
a stampede and trample him.

341
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,140
But I can see the paths they take.

342
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,940
Stop telling stories.

343
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,359
I'm not, I can sneak through!

344
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,280
You will not.

345
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,440
Aloy!

346
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,240
I need to move slowly and quietly
so I can sneak past them.

347
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,240
Can't let them see me.

348
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,360
Got to be careful.

349
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,300
I need to see their paths.

350
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,080
Almost there.

351
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,460
There he is!

352
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,640
Hey!

353
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,380
What?

354
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,820
How … how is this …?

355
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Ssh!

356
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,840
Follow me.

357
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,620
How do you know to avoid them?

358
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,200
How are you doing this?

359
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,600
How is this possible?

360
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,540
So it is no plaything.

361
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,200
Wait.

362
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,180
All-Mother bless that girl.

363
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,960
Bless you both.

364
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,640
Boy!

365
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,220
She saved me.

366
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,160
I just want to…

367
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,820
← BOY!

368
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,540
Seal your lips!

369
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,060
They are outcasts both.

370
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,100
And she is motherless.

371
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,260
Come now!

372
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,560
Back to Mother's Heart.

373
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,100
That boy should not have spoken to us.

374
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,180
It's against tribal law.

375
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,180
We'll go home now.

376
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,360
Follow.

377
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
I know the way!

378
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,300
"Seal your lips boy … seal your lips"

379
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,260
Aah!

380
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,520
Stay away No Mother!

381
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,360
[offscreen]
Children, away from there!

382
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,200
[offscreen]
Back to picking berries.

383
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,660
You're bleeding.

384
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,420
Let me have a look.

385
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,840
Here, hold still, I'll get it.

386
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,800
Why?

387
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Ssh!

388
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,280
Why am I an outcast?

389
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,599
Aloy, this is not the time.

390
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,069
Who was my mother?

391
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:41,369
Aloy, I've told you before
that's not for us to know.

392
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:44,760
You were just a newborn when
the Matriarchs brought you to me.

393
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,060
So the Matriarchs they know?

394
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,040
It's not so simple!

395
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,340
But they know?

396
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,620
Aloy, we are outcasts.

397
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,640
So how do I make them tell me?

398
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,290
The Matriarchs?

399
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,650
There is a way, perhaps.

400
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:01,720
So tell me!

401
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,260
It would be dangerous.

402
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,279
How?

403
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,209
It would take years of training.

404
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,520
I don't care!

405
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,640
How do I do it?

406
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,869
Tell me!

407
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,559
The Proving.

408
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,170
The tribe's rite of passage held every year.

409
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,130
Those who pass become Braves.

410
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,660
But to the one who wins
the Matriarchs grant a boon.

411
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,900
A boon?

412
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,420
Yes, whatever the winner wants.

413
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,520
Then I'll do it.

414
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,240
Whatever it takes.

415
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,920
I'll win the Proving.

416
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,160
I see.

417
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,120
We'd best get started then.

418
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,980
Your training will be hard
and it will take years.

419
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,980
Start training?

420
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,980
Yes!

421
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,940
Follow!
