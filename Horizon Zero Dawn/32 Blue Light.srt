1
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,149
I heard an interesting rumour about a Banuk camp.

2
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:30,638
They say the Banuk there live alongside machines, peaceful as you like.

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,539
Keep 'em, use 'em, sing to 'em.

4
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:41,729
If it's true, if we learned how they do it,
think how valuable that would be to all the tribes!

5
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,020
When you say valuable, you mean they'd pay you for it?

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,750
Heh, the last bunch just wanted to know about the reward.

7
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,850
You're a smart one.

8
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,379
I hired men to investigate.

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,750
Just investigate, that's all.

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,828
Those Banuk are canny, too canny.

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,762
I paid up front, well, half up front.

12
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:06,250
I've had no word back.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,250
So now you're hiring someone to find the last men you hired.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,528
If it's true they walk among machines without fear in this camp.

15
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,099
Well, you can't miss that, can you?

16
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,960
I think I'm in the clear.

17
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,421
[whistle]

18
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,650
Never know when I might need these.

19
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,970
I'll do what I have to.

20
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,707
[whistle]

21
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,642
[whistle]

22
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,851
Okay, they're heading back.

23
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,449
Now they're hunting me.

24
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,629
Ho!

25
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,870
Glad I found this.

26
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,610
Let's get this over with.

27
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,130
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

28
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,567
That's it, nothing to see here.

29
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,139
Got it!

30
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,340
Just go about your business.

31
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,962
Good, I can use this.

32
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:53,549
Dawn breaking, every time's different.

33
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,259
Hope you'll go quietly.

34
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,152
Low and quiet does it.

35
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
[whistles]

36
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,779
Ah, perfect!

37
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,619
A little more…

38
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,259
Ready or not!

39
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,950
Red light means trouble!

40
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:51,656
Getting soaked from melted snow.

41
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,470
This has to be the Banuk camp that Vilgund told me about.

42
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,573
So what happened to the other mercenaries he sent?

43
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:00,695
The machines are docile.

44
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:04,182
It's like they've already been overridden.

45
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,660
[Banuk hunter]
I don't like spending so long away from the hunt.

46
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,049
[Banuk hunter]
It makes my muscles twitch.

47
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,814
[Aluki]
The last hunt was a good one.

48
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:10,000
To see these machines up close like this, it's…

49
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,409
Grazer dung.

50
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,599
I'm sorry?

51
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,676
Frozen Grazer dung.

52
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,559
This Ravager led me here.

53
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,338
I chased it down from the Rivals, where it killed a great ice hunter.

54
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,675
Tore him in two.

55
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:24,300
A challenge I accepted.

56
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,269
But when it reached this camp the fury left it.

57
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,360
Isn't that a good thing?

58
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,487
Tikuk says it's a gift.

59
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:34,980
Pff, what is a gift but a reward that you didn't earn?

60
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,157
The machines are meant to challenge us!

61
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,980
Now I'm stuck here guarding the Shamans.

62
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,289
[Banuk hunter]
We should find a few machines, earn the spirit's favour.

63
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,534
Greetings Nora, I am Tikuk.

64
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:07,363
Shaman, I've never seen anything like this.

65
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,465
[laughs]

66
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:12,679
The blue light is strong here.

67
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:19,579
My people travelled far from the heights of Ban-Ur
to experience it for themselves.

68
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,100
The "blue light"?

69
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,090
The light of the machine spirits.

70
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,159
It is all around us.

71
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,650
It settles upon us.

72
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:33,619
This is how it used to be before they grew angry.

73
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:39,239
I know about the Derangement,
but I didn't think the machines were ever this calm.

74
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,278
What is it about this place?

75
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,159
We don't really know.

76
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:48,739
We sing and we listen to the machine songs.

77
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,500
The machines sing to you?

78
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,260
To each other.

79
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,108
You are a hunter.

80
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:01,869
You must have heard their communions and hymns, their calls and cries.

81
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,242
We're not meant to understand, but we Shamans try to interpret.

82
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,062
What is the song that angered them so?

83
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,159
That turned them upon us?

84
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:15,860
What song soothes them?

85
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,028
I was drawn to this place in a storm.

86
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,050
At first I thought the keening was the wind,
snapping off the mountain's frozen face.

87
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,289
But no, it was the Thunderjaw's song.

88
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,798
I found it crouched on its haunches.

89
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,679
Its metal unmoving, and I took shelter beneath it.

90
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,649
When the storm cleared, its singing done,
perhaps the spirit left its great shell.

91
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:47,039
Or perhaps it slumbers and remains.

92
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,868
So we have not stripped and gleaned this one.

93
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,067
We treat it with the care it is owed.

94
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,659
Tikuk, have any other outlanders come through here recently?

95
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:00,274
Some Oseram, yes.

96
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:04,300
They were convinced the machines were "malfunctioning".

97
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,218
As if machines were mere devices in need of repair.

98
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,239
Well, that is how the Oseram see the world, is it not?

99
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:20,000
They ate with us, then when they were satisfied
there was nothing they could explain, they left with the northern light.

100
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,034
Do you mind if I look around more Tikuk?

101
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:30,659
Speak, trade, listen. You are welcome. No harm will come to you here.

102
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,829
So it's not the Banuk that are doing this.

103
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:36,130
There's something about this place.

104
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,568
They can't see it, but maybe my Focus can.

105
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,734
Shaman, you're trying to understand the machines here too?

106
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,239
Yes, Nora.

107
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,190
And taking my time with my studies.

108
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:22,869
Between you, me, and the spirits, I appreciate the peace.

109
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,869
Not just from the machines.

110
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,829
There are many changes in Ban-Ur.

111
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,139
The hunters and Shamans bicker without end.

112
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,866
What about?

113
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:37,179
How best to deal with a harsher world.

114
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:41,329
The hunters, they don't want it back the way it used to be.

115
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,400
And we Shamans find ourselves able to explain less and less.

116
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,739
So many are exiles now, sent to wander.

117
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,030
Here, no-one argues.

118
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,329
So I welcome mystery.

119
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,199
Can my Focus show me anything?

120
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,630
[Banuk hunter]
Keep your skills sharp.

121
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,320
[Banuk hunter]
Well prepared for the hunt.

122
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,059
There, a signal, and the source is at the top of the mountain.

123
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,050
I'd better look into it.

124
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,230
[Banuk]
I'm glad to see you…

125
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,030
This is how the Banuk must have gotten up and down the mountain.

126
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:50,969
Glinthawks are just waiting.

127
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,702
A good sign, I guess.

128
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:03,179
Someone's been up here recently.

129
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,409
Is that voices?

130
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,920
[in the distance]
You can't just leave us here!

131
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,739
Did Vilgund send you?

132
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,099
I guess shards can buy a conscience.

133
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,978
Never mind that.

134
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,034
Nora girl, you have to stop the others up ahead.

135
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:46,608
We snuck up here, uncovered some kind of ancient device.

136
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,019
Plain as an anvil that's what affects the machines.

137
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,351
The other bungheads voted to take it to Pitchcliff for auction.

138
00:43:54,351 --> 00:44:00,000
But it's taken a beating already, like it dropped from the sky.

139
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,188
We tried to stop them digging it out.

140
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,840
Without that thing up here, those Banuk will be massacred.

141
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:09,278
I'll stop them.

142
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,829
You two get out of here.

143
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:13,188
Sounds like you've already done enough damage.

144
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,909
Well, that's a fair appraisal.

145
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,288
[in the distance]
What did you let the rope slip for?

146
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:47,888
[in the distance]
You bunch of chuffskulls.

147
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,290
[in the distance]
The slack was on your end.

148
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:52,588
[in the distance]
I think it's okay.

149
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,170
[in the distance]
Looks like it's okay, doesn't it?

150
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,300
[in the distance]
It's only split in half.

151
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:59,159
[in the distance]
Get a whiff of that smoke, it's burned out.

152
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,460
What have you done?

153
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,670
Who are you?

154
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,500
You're not one of those Banuk.

155
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm too late.

156
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,500
Let me look at it!

157
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,889
Hold on, hold on.

158
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,398
This was our delve.

159
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,518
We did the work.

160
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,429
You want to put your axe in, what's this thing worth to you?

161
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:15,288
It's worth more to me than you are.

162
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,000
You still want to negotiate?

163
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,718
I don't know about this.

164
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,128
This was your idea.

165
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,106
You started it, you can finish.

166
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,582
Forget it, all the east's ever given me is black toes.

167
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,265
They've made a mess off this.

168
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,929
"Catastrophic malfunction"?

169
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,300
This is from long ago.

170
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:44,860
And it's been sending a signal all this time, fading out.

171
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:59,409
I have to get back to the camp before the machines tear it apart.

172
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,800
No! They've already started attacking.

173
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,590
[Aluki]
The hunt is back!

174
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,473
[Tikuk]
The machines are angered, keep your distance!

175
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:30,565
[Tikuk]
Hunters, defend the camp. Do what you must.

176
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:39,288
[Aluki]
Yes, roar and rend at me! I don't fear it.

177
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:59,248
[Aluki]
Now you'll hear my song, machine! A sharp song!

178
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,429
[Aluki]
The hunt is back!

179
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:27,190
So much for Tikuk's peace. It was only a side effect.

180
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,650
He's not gonna be happy about this.

181
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,989
[Banuk hunter]
That was a little too easy.

182
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:08,079
[Aluki]
This long hunt is over.

183
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,630
Nora, did you know this change would come upon us?

184
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:20,690
Not exactly.

185
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:24,079
Although I know there is a lot changing in our world.

186
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:28,088
This time, it was outsiders. Those Oseram thought…

187
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:30,348
The Oseram do not think!

188
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,690
They will never understand the balance between us.

189
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:36,349
Between man and machine.

190
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:46,409
Now the blue light has gone and we are left with many songs,
but more for mourning than gratitude.

191
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:47,900
So what now?

192
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:50,429
Will you go back to your homeland?

193
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:59,319
When we teach the young to walk on shifting ice,
we say the secret is taking one step, then the next.

194
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:05,849
Perhaps one day we will understand the machines' mysteries.

195
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:09,600
I hope so. Good luck, Tikuk.

196
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,210
[Banuk]
Oh well.

197
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:45,400
Ah, this scrapes!

198
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:14,260
They're scanning for me.

199
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:42,360
Snow haze, white as bone. Huh, that thought got dark.

200
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,460
Here they come.

201
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,500
They know I'm here now.

202
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,150
[Bandit]
Got picked off.

203
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,070
The machine saw me.

204
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:46,997
Ha ha, I dropped it!
