1
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,038
I live in Lone Light.

2
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,550
I barely escaped because Glinthawks attack anyone who ventures out.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,769
We have so few shards.

4
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,049
Will you help?

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,149
We have nowhere else to turn.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,350
Sometimes members receive an honorarium for the hunt.

7
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,600
Ahsis should have accepted this one, but he refused.

8
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,219
The price was too low.

9
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,849
How generous.

10
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:47,710
In the past, I would have gone with Tarkas to handle this.

11
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,739
What say you and I take it on?

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,350
I'll meet you at Lone Light.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,009
What about Redmaw?

14
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,649
Are you in or not?

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,040
Alright, I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,530
A start!

17
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,366
That'll keep my stomach quiet.

18
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,084
By the Sun! Are you Nora?

19
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:14,140
I've never seen one at a Hunting Grounds before.

20
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,673
Or the Hunters Lodge.

21
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:17,791
How interesting.

22
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,816
Who are you? Where are you here?

23
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,943
Well, I'm a hunter, of course, and a member of the Hunters Lodge.

24
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:27,165
But I don't mind being out here.

25
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:34,163
At least no one complains about my clothes, or my manners, or my personality.

26
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,097
"Don't let him in, he'll drive people off with his incessant chattering"

27
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:42,721
or "he stinks of fish again", that sort of thing.

28
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,059
I don't stink of fish, do I?

29
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,589
No, it's more like wet fur.

30
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,798
Well, that's something.

31
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,376
What do you do here?

32
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:56,081
The trials here focus on the most important part of hunting.

33
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,937
Keeping your stamina up.

34
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,631
Hunting isn't a sprint.

35
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,195
It's a gauntlet.

36
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,387
So all you offer is training?

37
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,614
What trial will you run today?

38
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,940
The remains of Watchers rest on three rises.

39
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:15,225
Loot all of them before time runs out and you'll pass.

40
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:20,303
It sounds simple, but watch out for all the other machines down there.

41
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,195
I'll start timing once you slide down the rope.

42
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,311
You won a Blazing Sun on your first attempt!

43
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,220
Congratulations!

44
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:04,076
For this trial you'll need to be able to tie down
a Trampler and shoot off a component.

45
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,702
But you'll need the right weapon first.

46
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:00,690
in this trial, you must tie down a Trampler and shoot off the component under its belly.

47
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,990
I'll start timing once you choose a rope.

48
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:13,255
You won a Blazing Sun on your first attempt!

49
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,414
Congratulations!

50
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,043
Now's your chance to show you can snare Glinthawks.

51
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,692
Lure them close to you, then tie them down in time to pass this test.

52
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:30,735
Are you ready?

53
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,215
Spotted!

54
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:30,833
You won a Blazing Sun on your first attempt!

55
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,773
Congratulations!

56
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,125
I should leave for now.

57
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,138
'Til the next hunt!

58
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:46,935
[Talanah]
About time you showed up, more Glinthawks incoming!

59
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,593
[Talanah]
More coming!

60
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:11,778
[Talanah]
You're not walking away from this.

61
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:25,137
Better. No more time to recover.

62
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,457
That seems to have taken care of them.

63
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,845
But more always come.

64
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,677
The soldiers at Morning's Watch don't even bother to fight them anymore.

65
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:48,408
It seems like they're coming from upriver.

66
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:52,934
I could track them back to the source, but if more come here…

67
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:55,197
I'll watch the village, you go ahead.

68
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,819
I thought you wanted to do this together?

69
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,006
You don't need me to hold your hand.

70
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,392
Patterns on this flower are so strange.

71
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:40,343
[Carja outlander]
For the Sundom!

72
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:21,401
I've just got to tough the storm out.

73
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,679
More Glinthawks.

74
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:31,076
You're not gonna like this!

75
00:40:58,708 --> 00:40:59,617
There!

76
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:16,149
There are Snapmaw carcasses everywhere.

77
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:19,117
No wonder the Glinthawks were drawn here.

78
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,431
Those blinds, amateurs will leave easy tracks to follow.

79
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,027
These must be the Snapmaw hunters.

80
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:42,228
I'm here on behalf of the nearby village.

81
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:46,103
Seems your kill zone is creating a Glinthawk problem for them.

82
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:48,646
Yeah, well, they're not the only people with problems.

83
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:53,052
If we don't get enough Snapmaw hearts to pay off a loan, we lose everything.

84
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:54,750
I don't follow?

85
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,697
I borrowed shards to buy seeds.

86
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:01,544
The harvest went bust, and now they're coming for the debt.

87
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,477
We could lose the farm, our home.

88
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:06,092
I'm sorry about that.

89
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:09,480
But Glinthawks are attacking people because of what you're doing here.

90
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,153
Not my problem.

91
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:14,507
None of us are leaving until I get what I came for.

92
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:15,704
None of us?

93
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:24,407
You didn't think it was just us two, did you?

94
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:27,952
I'll make it simple for you.

95
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:32,538
Stop slaughtering machines for one component, leaving the rest to waste.

96
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:34,634
Now I'll make it simple for you.

97
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:36,697
That's not going to happen.

98
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:38,686
So get out of here.

99
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,003
Seems we've come to an impasse.

100
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:42,634
Make your move.

101
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,467
So be it.

102
00:46:09,843 --> 00:46:11,332
[Carja outlander]
Enjoy your last breath!

103
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,301
[in the distance]
Aloy!

104
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,853
Fools! Bit off more than they could chew.

105
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:49,384
What a waste.

106
00:46:49,616 --> 00:46:51,895
But now I know you can handle yourself.

107
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,969
You were watching the whole time?

108
00:46:54,075 --> 00:46:55,305
Of course.

109
00:46:55,305 --> 00:46:59,209
Tarkas, may the Sun light his passing, taught me many things.

110
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:03,447
First of which was: a Hawk never abandons their Thrush.

111
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:06,029
Wait, are you saying…?

112
00:47:06,029 --> 00:47:08,549
I'd like to sponsor you for membership.

113
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:13,336
What do you say to hunting machines, winning trophies, and unseating Ahsis?

114
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,230
I'm in.

115
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:18,195
I'll meet you back at the Lodge as soon as I'm able.

116
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,418
I can always use these.
