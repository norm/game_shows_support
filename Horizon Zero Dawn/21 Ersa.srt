1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,178
I will not abandon her.

2
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,138
We only know she was taken.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,460
Not who took her.

4
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,308
I can help with that.

5
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,811
Ersa has an enemy among the Oseram.

6
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:34,069
A warlord named Dervahl.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,239
I expect to find him lurking somewhere near the border.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,539
I've already sent an agent to investigate.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,019
He'll be waiting for word from us at the market place in Pitchcliff.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,049
I can't move troops to the border without provoking the Oseram.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,270
But I could send a few Vanguardsmen.

12
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,549
And perhaps an exceptionally gifted Nora as well?

13
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,250
Little more.

14
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,803
Need them soon enough.

15
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,129
Low and quiet does it.

16
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,350
Hello!

17
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,350
These'll keep.

18
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,094
[Oseram]
Can't get a wink of sleep.

19
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:08,202
[Oseram]
The beds around here, just like the people, too damn soft.

20
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,139
This must be Pitchcliff.

21
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,429
Marad's agent should be in the market place by now. 

22
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,551
[Oseram worker]
Got a pair of sturdy Oseram hands, know how to put 'em to use.

23
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,740
[Oseram worker]
There'll always be work for me.

24
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,818
[Oseram worker]
There's plenty of work here, but not light.

25
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:40,889
No sign of Marad's guy?

26
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,470
He's had plenty of time to investigate.

27
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,370
We'd better look for him.

28
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,779
Damn right.

29
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,580
Well, someone left here recently and they were in a hurry.

30
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,744
[Oseram worker]
…wink of sleep. Bought my bed from a Carja, just like them its soft.

31
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,079
[Oseram outlander]
Every resident of this city deserves safety and security. That's the deal.

32
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,799
Has to be Marad's guy.

33
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,800
Dervahl's thugs must have made him.

34
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,659
Maybe because he found something.

35
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,350
Look at this.

36
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,000
I think he drew a map with his own blood.

37
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,929
Right, those kind of maps you know you'd better follow.

38
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,719
That might be Pitchcliff.

39
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,739
He marked a spot to the north.

40
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,369
Could be Dervahl's location.

41
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,169
My men are waiting outside of town.

42
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,850
I'll grab them and meet you there.

43
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,850
[whistle]

44
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,049
Let's make this quick.

45
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,759
Here they come.

46
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,579
Come on, now!

47
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:12,549
Machines, looks like they've been chained up.

48
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,599
Dervahl's a tinker.

49
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
He probably experiments on them.

50
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,920
Or strips them for parts.

51
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,980
Maybe I can use them to make some trouble.

52
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,568
I'll go in first.

53
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,328
Hold off until the fighting starts.

54
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,549
Alright, we've got your back.

55
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,329
Dervahl's men.

56
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,078
It's about to get ugly.

57
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,349
[Erend]
I hope so.

58
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,150
[Oseram Vanguardsman]
By the forge, move!

59
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:05,299
Low and quiet does it.

60
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,268
Dervahl says you gotta eat dirt.

61
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,372
Okay, no more sneaking.

62
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:34,138
[Erend]
Ersa must be in there.

63
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,750
[Erend]
We have to get through.

64
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,920
They must use these to protect themselves from that awful sound.

65
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,889
Ersa!

66
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,750
Erend?

67
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,809
Dervahl tried to break me.

68
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,888
Shows what he knows.

69
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,659
I should have been with you.

70
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,659
Why didn't you come for me?

71
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,038
I know I'm a useless drunk, but…

72
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:56,679
No, idiot.

73
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:02,880
I got a message from Dervahl saying he wanted to parlay.

74
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,739
I didn't come for you because I knew it was a trap.

75
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,869
I couldn't let you get hurt.

76
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:12,340
Just didn't think it'd be that good a trap.

77
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,699
Thought I could take him out.

78
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:19,325
[coughs]

79
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,170
Now, listen.

80
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,289
Dervahl's planning something big in Meridian.

81
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,449
He said he'd force Avad to watch as the smoke darkens their precious Sun.

82
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,840
Your king needs you.

83
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:39,110
No more playing around.

84
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,949
You're gonna have to grow up fast.

85
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,099
I will.

86
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,945
I promise.

87
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:48,340
You damn well better little brother.

88
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:53,449
Ersa!

89
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,480
No, no! Please!

90
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,039
I won't let you down.

91
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,159
I promise.

92
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:11,960
Erend, I'm…

93
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm so sorry.

94
00:37:15,429 --> 00:37:16,800
We've gotta find Dervahl.

95
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,610
But Meridian's a big place.

96
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,673
I'll…

97
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,190
I'll look through his things.

98
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,949
Maybe we can narrow it down.

99
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:34,349
Just give me some time with Ersa.

100
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:43,170
Such a strange device.

101
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,239
It's beautifully crafted.

102
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,039
What happens when I turn it on?

103
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,989
[Dervahl]
"I think I've got it working."

104
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,058
[Dervahl]
"There. Now, say something, both of you doves."

105
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,099
[Dervahl's wife]
"I don't know. What do you want me to say?"

106
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,579
[Dervahl]
"Whatever you want."

107
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,400
[Dervahl's wife]
"I just want to hear your voice and keep it for later."

108
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,900
[Dervahl's daughter]
"I'll sing Papa! La la la la la la la!"

109
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:21,079
"[giggles]"

110
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:24,688
[Dervahl]
"There, a song and a laugh."

111
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,599
[Dervahl]
"Even better than words."

112
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,030
[Dervahl]
"And now I can hear them whenever I want."

113
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,518
[Dervahl's wife]
"We're done then? Off to bed with you."

114
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,608
[Dervahl's daughter]
"Good night, Mama."

115
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,030
[Dervahl's daughter]
"Good night, Papa."

116
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,239
[Dervahl's wife]
"Is she gone?"

117
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,009
[Dervahl's wife]
"What are we going to do?"

118
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,018
[Dervahl's wife]
"The raids are getting closer and closer to Mainspring."

119
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,840
[Dervahl's wife]
"How much longer can we hide like this?"

120
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,849
A keepsake from his family.

121
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,980
Dervahl's got nothing left to lose.

122
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:54,239
This machine's been picked apart with precision.

123
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,329
What's Dervahl learned from all his tinkering?

124
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,530
Do I even want to know?

125
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,315
Dervahl's records maybe?

126
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,070
Just notes about crafting.

127
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:39,739
Oh, and a letter tucked between the pages.

128
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,650
Lots of Blaze headed to Meridian.

129
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:46,639
If we find it, I'll bet we find Dervahl too.

130
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,869
I think I found something that can help.

131
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,869
Let's head back to the palace.

132
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:54,829
Go.

133
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,440
I won't be long, but I need to tend to my sister.

134
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,659
[whistle]

135
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:29,784
Here they come.

136
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,659
They saw us.

137
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,688
Low and quiet does it.

138
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,414
I'll find a use for you.

139
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,228
Here we go again.

140
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:36,695
Those Glinthawks must be here for the scrap.

141
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,398
[Carja outlander]
…only experience adventure…
