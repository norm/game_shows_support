1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,838
AIDABA: So you have marks for me?

2
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,339
ALOY: What do you mean?

3
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,989
From the Hunting Grounds.

4
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,140
Oh, right. You're new here.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,100
What do you want with my marks?

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,139
You hunters and your badges.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,759
I'm not gonna take them.

8
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,649
What do I do with these marks?

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,031
If you earn marks in all three trials
at each of the five Hunting Grounds, come to me.

10
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:43,143
I can give you up to three weapons.

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,850
One for fifteen Half Suns,

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,538
one for fifteen Full Suns,

13
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:49,339
and one you'll love for all Blazing Suns!

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,000
I need a few more.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,809
Okay.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,750
Once you get marks from the trials at every Hunting Ground,
come back and we'll see what I can give you.

17
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,568
Aren't you a little out of your way, Nora?

18
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:18,000
Your Sacred Lands don't extend this far.

19
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,750
I go where I like.

20
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,349
What do you do here?

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,448
I'm the keeper of these hunting grounds.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,849
Which means, of course, that I'm the local representative of the Hunters Lodge.

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,378
I oversee the leverage trials here.

24
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,790
Not that a vagabond Nora has any chance of passing them.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,579
You might be surprised.

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,938
I doubt it.

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,849
So how'd you wind up here?

28
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,012
I didn't "wind up" here, it's an honour.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,349
I don't expect you to get it, but I'm
well regarded at the Hunters Lodge back in Meridian.

30
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,420
So much so they sent you out here to pitch your tent in the wilds?

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,709
Are you going to take part in a trial or stand here prattling at me?

32
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,338
Tell me about the trials.

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,618
These hunting grounds offer the leverage trials.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,150
They focus on gaining an edge by leveraging machines against each other.

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
You might, for instance, take a weapon from one machine and use it on another.

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,849
It's hard, but the firepower is often worth the risk.

37
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,280
Let me know which trail you're interested in.

38
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:26,048
For this trial you must use the cannon on a Ravager's back
to take down other machines.

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,849
KEEPER: And so it's time to begin.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,273
Heavy, it's hard too.

41
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,250
Needed that.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,639
Back to your business.

43
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,519
I can't believe it.

44
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,949
You've earned a Blazing Sun on the first try.

45
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,739
I know who you are, girl.

46
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,519
The Nora who can control machines.

47
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,149
So I've got a trial just for you.

48
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,349
Use your spear to take control of two Ravagers.

49
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,100
Get them to help you take down a Thunderjaw.

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,326
Good hit!

51
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,850
I think I'm in the clear.

52
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,548
I can't believe it.

53
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,960
You've earned a Blazing Sun on the first try.

54
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,799
For this trial, you must use the Thunderjaw's cannon to destroy Ravagers.

55
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,549
KEEPER: Get out there and give it your best.

56
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,330
I've almost got you!

57
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,409
Now they're hunting me.

58
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,678
I can't believe it.

59
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,049
You've earned a Blazing Sun on the first try.

60
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,879
I'll be going now.

61
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,399
Uh-huh.

62
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,990
Glinthawks, they're never giving up scrap.

63
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Aah.

64
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,049
I'll find a use for you.

65
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,460
Mmm, I waited for you.

66
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,869
Time passing pulls the anticipation tight as wire.

67
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,667
Ah, how many has it been now?

68
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,607
I don't keep count, Nil.

69
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,600
Don't keep count? Sometimes I just don't get you.

70
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,660
Are you like us or a little different?

71
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,660
Hopefully a little different.

72
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,160
That's what you're gonna tell yourself.

73
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,960
Shall we get started?

74
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,660
Full already.

75
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,259
Can't be too prepared.

76
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,549
BANDIT: Saw a herd of Shell-Walkers and thought it was my lucky day.

77
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:07,686
ALOY: That's an alarm. Would make enough noise to bring in more.

78
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,869
ALOY: That puts it out of action.

79
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,299
BANDIT: Get her!

80
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,041
BANDIT: Who knows where she is?

81
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,648
BANDIT: …got trouble, light the signal!

82
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,646
BANDIT: Die, die!

83
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,740
BANDIT: I missed! You're dead, dead!

84
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,130
ALOY: Hello!

85
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,875
ALOY: The bandit's captives.

86
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,569
BANDIT: Fight!

87
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:52,990
CARJA: Just because he failed to kill the Sun-King
doesn't mean he's any less guilty, he should pay!

88
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,822
CARJA: So there are Oseram in the Sundom now.
I get up, I work, same as always.

89
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:06,243
CARJA: Ugh, egg for breakfast and it's not sitting well with me.

90
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:37,433
CARJA: The Oseram have gone too far
this time, Dervahl should die for his crimes.

91
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:44,450
CARJA: We owe you for defending the Sun-King.

92
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,619
ALOY: Forget about travelling light.

93
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,079
CARJA: If I got my hands on Dervahl…

94
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,788
CARJA: What reason do Oseram need for anything that they do?

95
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:51,417
CARJA: That crazy Oseram … 'til the machine rider stopped him.

96
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,549
CARJA: Didn't even hesistate. She stood between the assassin and our Sun-King.

97
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,789
These little moments are refreshing, aren't they?

98
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,980
That could be the least creepy thing you've said to me.

99
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:42,009
Aah, that glimpse of yourself in their eyes,
just as the cloud of death passes across them.

100
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,765
Never mind, there it goes.

101
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:47,239
Ambushes, raiding parties, even corrupted machines!

102
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,670
The mortal wounds just open themselves to accept my arrows.

103
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,490
But you knew this already.

104
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,259
You've been walking on the edge of life and death.

105
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,160
I can tell.

106
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,644
Yeah, it's a long story.

107
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:05,549
With many quick endings, I hope.

108
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:10,819
You know, Nil, if you get tired of bandits, there is a group called "The Eclipse".

109
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,049
That's a political situation.

110
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,019
They're murderers, and they're raising an army of machines,
that's a little more than politics.

111
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,789
Don't hate me for being single-minded.

112
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:27,946
Besides, I wouldn't bet on how long the Shadow Carja
are gonna last if you're in for the kill.

113
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,500
Makes you wish you could kill them more than once doesn't it?

114
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,838
No, once is enough.

115
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,789
You're right, of course, once is enough when you really make it count.

116
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:42,101
What's the matter? You look disappointed.

117
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,289
Oh, the bandit clans have gone.

118
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:51,104
I hear another turned back at the southern plains
just at a sniff of the legend we carved.

119
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,000
That's what all this bloodshed was for, to end the bandit threat.

120
00:30:56,009 --> 00:31:01,549
But now there is nothing left to kill … unless? No, no.

121
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,640
I guess this is our last farewell.

122
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,506
After all we've been through this isn't the place for that.

123
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,259
There's a mesa south of Meridian with a view of the Spearshafts.

124
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,259
Meet me there.

125
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,352
Stocking up! [whistle]

126
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,768
I've been seen!

127
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,351
It'd be fascinating if they weren't looking for me. 

128
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:26,409
Gotta follow up!

129
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Uh-oh!

130
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:04,091
Safe, for a few minutes anyway.

131
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:01,941
What is this place?

132
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:03,775
Sssh!

133
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,160
Er, what are you doing?

134
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:09,900
I was listening to the herd.

135
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,008
Have you come for the stealth trials?

136
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,900
I'm not sure.

137
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,133
You must decide.

138
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,900
Who are you?

139
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,633
I am the keeper of these grounds.

140
00:45:20,633 --> 00:45:22,633
So how did you come to be here?

141
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,767
I was once, like many members of the Lodge, manoeuvring, hunting for status.

142
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,567
But my impatience hampered the true hunt.

143
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,867
Are you a member?

144
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,900
No, I am only a Fledgling.

145
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:41,233
I prefer the music of the wild over the cacophony of squawking birds.

146
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:42,000
I didn't know that, of course, until I came here.

147
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,200
It forced me to listen, to breathe.

148
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:51,900
And finally to master the art of stealth.

149
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:55,867
Don't you ever miss, you know, talking?

150
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,067
Not at the moment, no.

151
00:45:58,367 --> 00:45:59,833
What are the trials?

152
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,967
I offer the stealth trials.

153
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,233
Some believe charging in with a mighty weapon makes them a hunter.

154
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,000
But it's a good way to fall under the hooves of a stampede.

155
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,733
A true hunter chooses the approach that best suits the kill.

156
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,400
Mastering stealth may well save your life.

157
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,167
Have you decided which trial you'll take?

158
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,067
Choose and I can give you the details.

159
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:31,833
The Watchers of the herd attack quickly.

160
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:35,433
Take them down while in stealth to prove your skill.

161
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,633
KEEPER: I start timing once you slide down a rope.

162
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:03,000
No need to draw attention.

163
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:23,383
Can't have you giving away the hunt.

164
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,900
I can get out of this.

165
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,500
Such skill from an outlander on your first attempt.

166
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Take this Blazing Sun as your proof.

167
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,233
Shell-Walkers guard their cargo with their lives.

168
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,800
In this trial, you must loot four of their containers in the allotted time.

169
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,400
KEEPER: Let the trial begin.

170
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:18,707
I think I'm in the clear.

171
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:36,900
Such skill from an outlander on your first attempt.

172
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:40,400
Take this Blazing Sun as your proof.

173
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:49,933
Stalkers have defeated many hunters who favour brute force over patience.

174
