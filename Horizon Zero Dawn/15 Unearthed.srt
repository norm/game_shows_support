1
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,679
Now that I know where to find Olin, I should be on my way.

2
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,506
Wait, if that device lets you see the unseen…

3
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:31,428
Out of the way Erend.

4
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,829
I'm asking you to help me, Aloy.

5
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,639
I need to know who killed Ersa.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,320
Why should you have justice and not me?

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,149
Look, I'll head for Red Ridge Pass
where Ersa's body was found and wait for you there.

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,170
A few minutes of your Focus is all I need.

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,469
Don't make me beg.

10
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,860
Not yet.

11
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,110
Never know when I might need these.

12
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,560
Ah, she went that-a-way!

13
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,331
[Cultist]
The Sun can't save you now!

14
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,699
I can't spare the weight.

15
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,389
Tasty.

16
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,360
This is what you intend?

17
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,209
To bring these ancient things back to life.

18
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,773
Their power serves us.

19
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:58,170
[Olin]
Machine demons from beneath the ground.

20
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,239
It's a nightmare.

21
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,660
[Cultist]
Nightmares? Yes. The worst dreams of our enemies come true.

22
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,699
Yes! Rise!

23
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,319
So much for catching him alone.

24
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,009
These things will destroy us all!

25
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:44,083
They will only destroy our enemies and bring us back the lands that wer—AAAH!

26
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,478
My Focus, stopped working.

27
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:55,659
Search the area! We may may have intruders.

28
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,659
[voice from Focus]
Forgive this intrusion Aloy, you left me no choice.

29
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,070
Who is this?

30
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,970
[voice from Focus]
An interested party.

31
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,359
[voice from Focus]
Now the Focuses are disabled, but I don't know for how long.

32
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,169
[voice from Focus]
The rest is up to you.

33
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,029
Who is this?

34
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,649
[Olin]
The Nora girl lives!

35
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,539
[Cultist]
kill her!

36
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,568
[Olin]
No!

37
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,720
[Cultist]
You had your chance.

38
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,059
That's right, no-one here.

39
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,100
Full already.

40
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,569
[Olin]
I promise, I'll tell you everything!

41
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,470
The killers who came from me at the Proving, who are they?

42
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,388
The Eclipse, some kind of holy warriors.

43
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,582
A cult of the Shadow Carja.

44
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,960
Shadow Carja?

45
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,599
Except they're not like any Carja I've known.

46
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,229
They don't pray to the Sun.

47
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,649
They worship some kind of devil.

48
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,439
I'm not interested in their superstitions.

49
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,835
Oh, it's not a superstition.

50
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:04,987
Their devil is real. It has a name, a voice.

51
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,378
And you've heard it speak?

52
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,743
Steel to my soul, I heard.

53
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:12,849
Just once when it saw you. Such a voice.

54
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,608
A cold, awful jangle.

55
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,828
It scrapes your bones and hollows your guts, a metal sound.

56
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,038
But like nothing dug from the earth or smelted in a forge.

57
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,098
Hades, that's what they call it.

58
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,609
Hades? And what did it say?

59
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,099
"System threat detected". Just three words.

60
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,879
The Eclipse were sent to kill me because I look like another woman.

61
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,767
Older, maybe twice my age, short hair. Who is she?

62
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,847
I don't know. My Focus found her image once.

63
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:46,477
I had taken a delve near Maker's End, there was a door.

64
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:50,598
Beside it, a kind of ancient device that contained the woman's image.

65
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,970
My Focus recorded the location.

66
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,849
When I surfaced, they were waiting.

67
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,559
I laughed when I saw the priest, but then he showed me Helis's encouragement.

68
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,429
I didn't laugh after that.

69
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,319
They gave me a Focus to watch my every move.

70
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,259
I followed orders.

71
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,349
Why you?

72
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,699
I was a scrounger, a rummager in dark places.

73
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,139
Good at what I do.

74
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,069
I suppose they knew I would serve them well as a scout.

75
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,043
What are these Eclipse cultists after, besides me?

76
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,670
They never said!

77
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,950
But given the Carja civil war they must want
to overthrow Sun-King Avad and take Meridian back.

78
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,439
Why didn't they get to Avad through you?

79
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,189
Too much dirt under my nails for an audience with one true Sun-King.

80
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,449
But whatever Ersa or Erend told me?

81
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,149
The Eclipse heard every word through my Focus.

82
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,143
That's why I couldn't warn you.

83
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:46,848
If I tried they would have killed my family!

84
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,139
When they attacked the Proving a man came for me.

85
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,447
Tall, strong, dead eyes?

86
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,676
Helis.

87
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,139
And who is he?

88
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,006
The terror of the Sun.

89
00:18:57,006 --> 00:19:02,380
Stacker of Corpses we Oseram called him
when he was the Mad Sun-King's champion.

90
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,680
If only he died with his king.

91
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,369
But now he leads the Eclipse.

92
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,838
I tell you, he's the most dangerous man alive.

93
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,239
Why are the Eclipse digging up ancient machines,
and how do they get them to work?

94
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,485
I thought they wanted them for scrap, but they brought them back to life.

95
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:27,549
Plugged some kind of device into the corpses so that Hades
could whisper to them and call them from their grave.

96
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,271
I've fought that kind of machine before. Are there others?

97
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:37,003
Much bigger, bristling with ancient weapons, those they call Deathbringers.

98
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,288
I've only seen them buried in the ground.

99
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,769
But after today, anything is possible.

100
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,369
Sounds to me like they're raising an army.

101
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,259
If so, the world will fall.

102
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,538
And I helped dig the pit.

103
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,970
I've heard enough.

104
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,279
I won't beg for my life.

105
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:02,338
But if there's any mercy in you free my family, please.

106
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,859
Where would I find them?

107
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,209
My Focus recorded the location.

108
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,170
There are always guards there.

109
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,259
You look like you can handle yourself.

110
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,059
Your…

111
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,437
Your role in events was coerced.

112
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,569
Perhaps you're not an evil man.

113
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,368
Just a weak one.

114
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:21,660
I am.

115
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,239
The only strength I ever found in this life was my family.

116
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,180
It will take many good deeds to make up for the crimes you've committed.

117
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,681
You're sparing me? After all I've done?

118
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,910
Yes.

119
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,970
Forge a new life, Olin.

120
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,170
One of better make.

121
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,859
Then the rest of my life will be lived in your debt.

122
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,559
Go to the place where your family is being held and wait for me.

123
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,838
We'll make their lives the first ones you save.

124
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,859
I didn't earn this mercy, but I will die to make myself worthy of it.

125
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,259
I will be waiting for you.

126
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,598
It's Erend, and he's in trouble.

127
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,869
[Erend]
Take cover!

128
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,670
[Erend]
Die, damn you!

129
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,339
[Erend]
I'm glad that's over with.

130
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,869
[Erend]
Thanks for the help.

131
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,299
[Erend]
Come on over here and have a word.

132
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,979
Can't be too prepared.

133
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,460
[Erend]
Come on, what are you waiting for?

134
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,299
What are you doing out here all alone?

135
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
Where are your men?

136
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,139
I'm not going to risk their lives.

137
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,269
I don't mind putting my worthless ass on the line, but not theirs.

138
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,740
Sorry I had to drag you into it.

139
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,210
Don't worry, this is just an average day for me.

140
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,299
You know, take down some machines, track some killers.

141
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:47,848
Right, I'd hate to see a busy morning for you.

142
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,759
Ready to get started?

143
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,619
Are you sure you're all right?

144
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,869
Well, I'm sober, so … no.

145
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,068
Well, I'm glad you're thinking straight at least.

146
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:00,559
Don't get used to it.

147
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,180
Tell me exactly what happened to Ersa.

148
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,779
Start from the beginning.

149
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,569
No one knows for sure.

150
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,891
She left in the middle of the night with a few of her best men.

151
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:14,460
Her best men, but she didn't bring you?

152
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,170
No, I'd been drinking a lot.

153
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,559
Maybe she thought, ah damn I don't know, I couldn't hack it.

154
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:31,338
Search parties found their bodies the next day
and the corpses of some Shadow Carja cowards.

155
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,849
It was an ambush.

156
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,670
The Shadow Carja are animals.

157
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,279
They beat her so bad we can't even show her face before burial.

158
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,990
I'm so sorry, Erend.

159
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:51,064
Yeah, well, when I find the soldiers who did this, they'll be sorry too.

160
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:54,838
You don't have any idea why she left in the middle of the night?

161
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,949
No, but it must have been urgent.

162
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,757
A message, a report of some new Shadow Carja threat.

163
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:01,729
I don't know.

164
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,910
Why would the Shadow Carja do this?

165
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,677
Because they hate us and Ersa most of all.

166
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:11,279
She teamed up with Avad to kick their asses out of Meridian.

167
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,699
They've been licking their wounds for two years.

168
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,249
But they finally found a way to get back at her.

169
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,970
Alright, show me where Ersa fell and I'll do what I can to help.

170
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:23,369
Come on, follow me.

171
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,469
[Aloy]
Why would Ersa come all the way out here?

172
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,680
[Erend]
I don't know.

173
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,779
[Erend]
It doesn't make sense.

174
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,629
[Aloy]
Is this Shadow Carja territory?

175
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,679
[Erend]
No, they broke the ceasefire as soon as they set foot in the Cleft.

176
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,160
[Erend]
Almost there.

177
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,838
[Erend]
Right, this is it, where the ambush happened.

178
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,139
[Erend]
Our soldiers have been over it, but maybe that
fancy artifact of yours can find a clue or something.

179
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:22,349
[Erend]
Please, I need to find the bastards that did this.

180
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,559
A Shadow Carja spear.

181
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,869
That must be Shadow Carja armour.

182
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,589
These look like drag marks.

183
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,000
Those bloodstains, not the kind would pool around a corpse.

184
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,680
Arrows scattered there.

185
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,349
They look like smears.

186
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,460
It's perfectly sharp, never seen action.

187
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,769
Strange, not a scratch on it.

188
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,460
They look good as new, never fired.

189
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,269
Did someone move a body through here?

190
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,369
[Erend]
What do you see there?

191
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:06,180
This stain forms a line as if blood dripped off the edge of something, like a cart.

192
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,318
See? Cart tracks.

193
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,049
I think someone moved the bodies here, then scattered them across the field.

194
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,950
Wait, are you saying the dead found here were killed somewhere else?

195
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,369
But why would the Shadow Carja do that?

196
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,719
At this point?

197
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,879
I'm not taking it for granted that the Shadow Carja are responsible.

198
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,779
Of course they were.

199
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,849
Well, let's follow these tracks and find out.

200
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,778
[Erend]
I get why they wanted Ersa dead, but why fake an ambush?

201
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,869
[Aloy]
There's more to this and we're gonna figure it out.

202
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,615
These guys aren't Shadow Carja.

203
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,626
They're from my tribe, the Oseram!

204
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,508
Is this how your people usually greet each other?

205
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,431
[Oseram mercenary]
Incoming!

206
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,460
[Erend]
Uh-oh, what's that?

207
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,770
[Aloy]
I think it's calling in machines. Get ready.

208
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:58,116
[Erend]
I liberated Meridian!

209
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,768
[Erend]
See what happens when you mess with the Vanguard!

210
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,259
[Aloy]
That hurt it!

211
00:36:56,534 --> 00:36:59,493
Oseram, not Shadow Carja.

212
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:03,172
Looks like I was wrong about everything as usual.

213
00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:09,896
Please, use that second sight of yours.

214
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,754
I have to know what really happened.

215
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:12,803
I'm on it.

216
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,686
So much blood.

217
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:19,066
What are those leather straps?

218
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:24,775
A lot of people died here, a massacre.

219
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:32,153
Armour straps, cut with a knife, and a rock with blood on it.

220
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,111
These look like Vanguard weapons.

221
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:46,785
There's no blood on them.

222
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,161
Ersa's men didn't fight back.

223
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,766
Those rocks, they're shattered.

224
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:16,136
Something hit these stones, something I've never seen before.

225
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:19,555
This is Ersa's helmet.

226
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:24,460
I thought she died in the field below, but must have been here.

227
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,547
All this trickery for what?

228
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,876
Feels like it's just to torture me.

229
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,598
I have a theory.

230
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,465
But it takes a little imagination.

231
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:40,868
So far, your theories are better than other people's facts.

232
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:42,469
Alright.

233
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:46,382
I think the Oseram ambushed Ersa and her men with a new weapon.

234
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,466
They mounted it on that tripod up there.

235
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:52,668
It fires waves of force, maybe sound.

236
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,327
Looks like it cracked the stone there.

237
00:39:57,121 --> 00:40:02,150
I think it paralyzes people instead of killing them, it dropped the Vanguard right there.

238
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:05,072
No blood on their weapons.

239
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,223
No fight.

240
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:10,000
But why paralyze them if you're only gonna move them and gut them?

241
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,679
They were trying to hide something.

242
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:19,200
Look here, a bloody rock.

243
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:22,977
That they used to smash Ersa's face in.

244
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:24,630
Or someone else's.

245
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:30,390
These leather straps have been cut as if they took the armour off someone.

246
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,527
That can't be.

247
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:35,164
Her body is lying in state in Meridian.

248
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,404
I saw it!

249
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:40,222
You said she was unrecognisable.

250
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:43,072
Maybe they switched another body into her armour.

251
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,907
Someone around the same size.

252
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:48,102
And mutilated it enough so it could have been anyone.

253
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,668
Even Ersa.

254
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:53,396
Go back to Meridian.

255
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,349
Take another look at that body.

256
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,767
If it's really Ersa, of course I'm wrong.

257
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,341
But if I'm right…

258
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:05,866
…then my sister could be alive!

259
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:09,087
I'm going! Meet me back there when you can.

260
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:18,813
Dawn breaking, every time's different.

261
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:10,495
Stocking up.

262
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:48,094
I'll tuck that away.

263
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,130
It's drawing back.

264
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,064
Always watching.

265
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:26,970
[Carja spearman]
You're trash, now!

266
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,167
[Carja spearman]
Here we are!

267
00:53:12,882 --> 00:53:14,060
Got it!

268
00:55:37,422 --> 00:55:38,872
[whistle]
