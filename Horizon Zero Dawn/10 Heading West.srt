1
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,320
Varl told me you'd know the way to Meridian.

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,420
The Carja capital? West will take you to it.

3
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,820
But their soldiers will stop you long before you get there.

4
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,219
They can try.

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,869
No, what I mean is there's a Carja fort
that guards the pass between east and west.

6
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,905
Word is the Carja have sealed the gate,

7
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,250
out of fear of the corrupted machines infesting our Sacred Land.

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,039
The Carja call the place Daytower.

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,049
It's not far from the forsaken village.

10
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,819
Save these for the trail.

11
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,946
Grazers. I can override them if I don't spook them.

12
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,939
Scrappers. Happy to find salvage, as always.

13
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,860
Here we go again.

14
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,899
Gotta switch weapons.

15
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,389
[Carja merchant]
Come on, I don't have many shards and lives are on the line.

16
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:42,440
[Banuk]
You're right. Mine if I go looking for your friends. 

17
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,899
[Banuk]
So pay up or shut up.

18
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,129
[Carja merchant]
But without these explosive arrows they'll be torn to shreds.

19
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,450
[Banuk]
Not my problem.

20
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,569
[Banuk]
Unless someone wants to pay me to pick up the pieces.

21
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,120
[Carja merchant]
How could you be so cold?

22
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,989
[Banuk]
Where I come from that's a compliment.

23
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:56,909
[Banuk]
See you around.

24
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,820
Sounds like you have friends in danger.

25
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,071
Employees, not friends.

26
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,348
A caravan on its way to trade with the Banuk
along a trail that swarms with machines,

27
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,610
Scrappers and Longlegs from what I hear.

28
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,450
But there have been stories of something worse.

29
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,009
Something that strikes with no warning.

30
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,059
Without explosive arrows, they won't stand much of a chance.

31
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,909
Why would they leave their best ammunition behind?

32
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,671
I don't know.

33
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:26,809
Marzavid, the caravan boss, isn't the sort of man to make mistakes.

34
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,411
I brought the crate hoping to catch them here.

35
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,250
I barely got past the border before the commander sealed the gates.

36
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,065
For me to track them deeper into the wilds would be suicide.

37
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:39,110
Especially with those corrupted machines infesting the land.

38
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,299
If I come across the caravan, I'll do what I can to help.

39
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,210
Well, that's more than any of the worthless bums
hanging about this dungpit offered.

40
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,080
Here, take the ammunition I stockpiled for the caravan.

41
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,620
You're sure to need it.

42
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,600
And may the Sun shine upon you.

43
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,129
[crowd member]
I've hunted machines for so long.

44
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,439
[crowd member]
I don't know what to think of a place where they're peaceful.

45
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,679
[crowd member]
Curiosities.

46
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,429
It looks like Lubavad's men had to abandon some of their goods.

47
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,568
Lubavad's men must have killed these Watchers.

48
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:52,160
I hope they haven't run into anything worse.

49
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,299
You there!

50
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,599
I hope you've come to help because we're getting slaughtered out here.

51
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,710
Lubavad sent me after you.

52
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,609
Oh, I see.

53
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,529
And did he happen to tell you why he packed us a crate
of Ridge-Wood instead of decent ammunition?

54
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,406
Three waves of Watchers and Scrappers so far,
and worse to come.

55
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,000
Without that ammo, we're good as dead.

56
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,200
He said you left the ammunition behind.

57
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,910
Then the old fool has gone cross-eyed.

58
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,108
Every crate we loaded, I checked twice.

59
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,009
The glyph said ammunition.

60
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,176
But when we opened it, it was full of Ridge-Wood shafts and nothing but.

61
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:15,574
I have the ammunition with me. Enough for everyone.

62
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,220
By the Sun, we might just stand a chance after all.

63
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,398
Alarms! Longleg approaching!

64
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,819
To arms! To arms!

65
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,309
Come on, then.

66
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,661
[in the distance]
There's more machines! Scrappers!

67
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,710
I'd have to leave something else behind.

68
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,439
You fight well, outlander.

69
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,220
I'm surprised Lubavad was willing to pay for someone of your skill.

70
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,162
He didn't pay me, actually.

71
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:03,299
I did this for free.

72
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,009
Never trust a Carja merchant.

73
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:09,099
Boss! The Songcores are gone.

74
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,119
What?

75
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,619
That's impossible.

76
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,400
Unless â€¦ unless Dirid took them.

77
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:19,509
When the first wave hit us, one of the men ran off. Dirid.

78
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,440
I thought he was a coward.

79
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,621
Turns out he's a thief too.

80
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,278
He couldn't have gotten far.

81
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:27,930
True, but we're in no shape to go after him.

82
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,460
Then I'll get him for you.

83
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:32,060
But this time I get paid.

84
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,599
Quick learner, eh. Fine.

85
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,723
Bring those Songcores back and you've got a deal.

86
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,039
Hello Dirid.

87
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,339
Who are you?

88
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,209
The caravan sent me.

89
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,440
Caravan? What caravan?

90
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,339
The one you sabotaged.

91
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,009
You figured no explosive arrows meant no survivors.

92
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,039
No witnesses to your crime.

93
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,900
Look, stranger, I have debts.

94
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,119
If I don't pay, the dicers will gouge out my eyes.

95
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,799
The caravan.

96
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,700
Did they live?

97
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,140
Yes.

98
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,410
I got to them in time.

99
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,430
Thank you.

100
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,819
As I turn

101
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,509
and embrace the Sun

102
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,529
my He burn away

103
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,609
my sins.

104
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,236
What a waste.

105
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,319
At least he died better than he lived.

106
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,319
Never know when I might need these.

107
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,559
You're back.

108
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,640
And with the Songcores I see.

109
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,930
And Dirid?

110
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,339
A Stalker got him. It wasn't pretty.

111
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,680
And you beat a Stalker.

112
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,240
That's worth a bonus.

113
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,200
Here, take my share.

114
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,355
You've earned it.

115
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,259
I'll see to the caravan from here.

116
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,309
I think the rest of the trip will go smoother.

117
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,239
Not gonna be a problem overriding that Lancehorn.

118
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,210
Catching it, though.

119
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:13,580
[whistle]

120
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:43,346
It's off!

121
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,190
No room.

122
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:57,004
I know how to override a Sawtooth, if I can get in close. 

123
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:30,505
[whistle]

124
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,960
It'd be fascinating if they weren't looking for me.

125
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,480
All right!

126
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,122
I dropped it!

127
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,889
Gonna need this!

128
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,460
Didn't catch.

129
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,940
I'd have to ditch something.

130
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,750
Just stay out of their way for now.

131
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,101
Should have brought a cart.

132
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,010
This will do nicely.

133
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,809
Keep that for later.

134
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:50,409
An old gate, broken long ago.

135
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,500
So this was the Nora border before the war with the Carja.

136
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,500
The Carja fort, looks solid.

137
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,190
A little too solid to talk my way past.

138
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:42,728
No passage west, and no exceptions!

139
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,710
So long as corrupted machines prowl the valley.

140
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,130
Then why don't you do something about the infestation?

141
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,399
We have! We sealed the border!

142
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:54,800
Fine.

143
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,599
I'll come back once I've destroyed all the corrupted.

144
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,900
[laughs]

145
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:07,590
Huh? If you're serious, then may you go in light girl,
and the Sun guide your arrows.
