1
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:23,979
Now, listen.

2
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:27,660
Dervahl's planning something big in Meridian.

3
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,750
He said he'd force Avad to watch as the smoke darkens their precious Sun.

4
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,250
Your king needs you.

5
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,549
No more playing around.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,350
You're gonna have to grow up fast.

7
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,147
I will, I promise.

8
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,649
You damn well better little brother.

9
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:54,780
Ersa!

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,850
No, no! Please!

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,369
I won't let you down.

12
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,549
I promise.

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,189
[Carja merchant]
The machines grow more bloodthirsty every day.

14
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,180
[Carja merchant]
The Sun is still displeased.

15
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,650
[Carja artisan]
Eh, I've seen better.

16
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,270
[Carja artisan]
Oh, that's nice. Glad I stopped for a bit.

17
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,050
[Carja guard]
Some Oseram girl applied to the City Guard the other day…

18
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,384
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday sun. Words to live by.

19
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,053
[Carja guard]
It's not what I imagined when I was a boy, but it's decent work keeping the city safe.

20
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:16,575
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods!

21
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,219
[Carja guard]
It's always the ones you least expect that cause the trouble.

22
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,965
[Carja merchant]
Come take a look, I'll give you a good price.

23
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,586
[Carja merchant]
You won't find better wares.

24
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,620
[Carja outlander]
Most of the commoners…

25
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,838
[Carja outlander]
Women rising in the ranks of the Hunters Lodge? A real lady…

26
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,009
[Carja outlander]
The Sundom was founded here…

27
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,739
Talanah, always a pleasure.

28
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,388
I see you've brought your pet.

29
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,903
Greetings, Sunhawk.

30
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:28,726
I hereby sponsor Aloy of the Nora for membership in the Hunters Lodge.

31
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:31,600
No! Look at her.

32
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,360
She's low born, a savage.

33
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,649
This is beneath even you, Talanah.

34
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,000
She has fulfilled the requirements.

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
And Sun-King Avad decreed the Lodge should be open to all.

36
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:45,899
Would you like to take it up with him?

37
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,769
The word of the Sun-King is indeed law.

38
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,649
Even though it will bring ruin to the Lodge, so be it.

39
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:03,899
Do you, Aloy of the Nora, pledge to act rightly and nobly
when in service to the Lodge all the days to follow?

40
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,081
I do.

41
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:13,869
Members of the Lodge, even though Tarkas is barely cold,
I present to you Aloy of the Nora, member and Thrush.

42
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,821
What say you all?

43
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,149
To the hunt!

44
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,939
Sponsoring an outlander.

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,610
While you make meaningless gestures, I'll be finding Redmaw.

46
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,449
This, this is a good day.

47
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,009
What's Redmaw?

48
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,399
Few have seen it.

49
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,500
A Thunderjaw marked by years of battle.

50
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,750
Some say it still bears the marks of over a dozen hunters on its flank.

51
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,149
How many it has trampled along the way we may never know.

52
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,259
When members go hunting and never return, we often blame Redmaw.

53
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,050
But to me it's more than legend.

54
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,420
It's the only machine that will unseat Ahsis.

55
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,910
My sponsor nearly had it, but…

56
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,949
He didn't make it.

57
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,323
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,589
Tarkas sponsored me out of loyalty to my family.

59
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,052
He was my last link to them, besides the Lodge itself.

60
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,449
I have to unseat Ahsis.

61
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,860
I know why I hate Ahsis. Why do you?

62
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,769
My family has always boasted members in the Lodge.

63
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,259
My father and brother were both Hawks.

64
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,939
Ahsis let their sacrifice be forgotten.

65
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:34,579
Um, what sacrifice?

66
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,250
They died in the massacre.

67
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,066
They should be honoured as Hawks.

68
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,739
Instead Ahsis will not let anyone mention it.

69
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,159
What happened?

70
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,949
King Jiran's paranoia knew no bounds.

71
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,259
He sent thousands of innocents to die in the Sun Ring.

72
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,850
When the Hawks of the Lodge called for him to stop the slaughter,
he threw them in the ring too.

73
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,529
Yet when the machines attacked the condemned,
more Hawks leapt into the ring to defend them.

74
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,750
My father and brother were among them.

75
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm…

76
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,350
I'm so sorry.

77
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,759
If you wish to hear the story Ligan can tell it better.

78
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,829
He saw it with his own eyes.

79
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:13,949
I did not.

80
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,860
The morning of the massacre my father told me to meet him outside the city.

81
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,250
He told me they were planning an escape.

82
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,699
I waited for hours until a message came from my father.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,699
I had to leave the city.

84
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,550
So I fled when I should have fought by his side.

85
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,899
He didn't want you to die with them.

86
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,200
Nor would he want their names forgotten.

87
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,058
Especially by the man who benefited most from their deaths.

88
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,239
Ahsis.

89
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,121
How did your family come to be members of the Lodge?

90
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,299
Carja noble houses have sent sons to the Lodge for generations.

91
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,550
Because you need another place to lord over the commoners.

92
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,549
I want to change that.

93
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,649
The idea that someone is worthy or not by virtue of birth alone.

94
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,110
Everyone thinks they have me pegged as soon as they hear Talanah Khane Padish.

95
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,350
I hate that.

96
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,889
I understand.

97
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,580
My whole life I lived as an outcast from the Nora.

98
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,289
They would have been the first to say I wasn't one of them.

99
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,319
I didn't know.

100
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,504
Yet as soon as I leave the Sacred Land, everyone calls me Aloy of the Nora.

101
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:21,281
It should be Aloy despite the Nora.

102
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,460
You should improve your reputation.

103
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,200
Why don't you hunt down a Thunderjaw and a Stormbird.

104
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,450
You want me to go trophy hunting?

105
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,384
You're not just any Thrush, you're mine.

106
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:34,250
And you'd better make me look good.

107
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,139
But what about Redmaw?

108
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,148
Don't worry. I won't take on Redmaw without you.

109
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,089
I must say I'm surprised by your achievements.

110
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,500
Bringing in a Stalker already.

111
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,279
Save your surprise.

112
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,789
I'm just getting started.

113
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,090
Two new Thrushes in one day, makes a Hawk proud.

114
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,139
Thrushes are members sponsored by a Hawk.

115
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:25,850
They can't become a Hawk until their sponsor leaves, or passes away.

116
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,439
The Hawk who brings in the trophy from the fiercest machine is the Sunhawk.

117
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,980
He serves as ceremonial leader of the Lodge.

118
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,830
So now that Talanah is a Hawk, she could become Sunhawk?

119
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,139
Yes.

120
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,899
If she defeats Redmaw before Ahsis can, then she will take his place.

121
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,659
What exactly is Redmaw?

122
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,219
The meanest of all Thunderjaws.

123
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,737
Some say the first.

124
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:55,189
One swipe of its tail and five hunters go down.

125
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,049
Its stomps can send boulders tumbling before it.

126
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,798
More than a few have been crushed under their weight.

127
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,709
And thus, many have died trying to defeat it.

128
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,830
If Redmaw is so deadly, why do hunters keep going after it?

129
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,620
Anyone who defeats this beast will surely be considered a champion.

130
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,149
I watched Tarkas try his luck.

131
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,516
He jumped over each tail swipe, dodged every charge, evaded every shot from its gun.

132
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:26,316
Stumbling under its feet, he ran out to fire at range.

133
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,869
But it unleashed disc launchers.

134
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:32,668
The first missed him, but not the second.

135
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:34,259
Who was Tarkas?

136
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,288
Tarkas, Sun light his passing, was a Hawk.

137
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,370
A respected hunter.

138
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,340
He sponsored Talanah many years ago.

139
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,470
If Talanah was his Thrush, why did he fight Redmaw without her?

140
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,278
I went to watch the battle.

141
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,158
She should have received word he'd picked up its trail.

142
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,019
Someone at the Lodge failed to pass it on.

143
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,690
Can you tell me what happened during the massacre?

144
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,629
A terrible time.

145
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:05,330
King Jiran purged loyal subjects and traitors alike throughout the Sundom.

146
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,080
Even called out members of our Lodge.

147
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,960
Why?

148
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,740
Some spoke out against the killing.

149
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,049
And when the soldiers came for them we all objected.

150
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,440
And for that crime those who were not arrested were forced to watch our comrades murdered in the Sun Ring.

151
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,699
I shouldn't say more.

152
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,590
Please, tell me what happened that day in the Sun Ring.

153
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,959
Normally, victims of the Sun Ring fell within minutes as the crowd cheered.

154
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,288
Cheered their deaths, but not with our Hawks.

155
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,250
They stood alone against wave after wave of machines.

156
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,000
Hours passed, the men taking turns fighting as the others rested.

157
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,230
The crowd's mood turned, rallying around our men.

158
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:55,181
Some of them left, their bloodlust unsated.

159
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:59,360
We members stayed and watched 'til nightfall.

160
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,679
It was then the court released a Behemoth.

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,899
Several Hawks at once jumped into the ring to fight alongside the condemned.

162
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,079
They had snuck in their weapons.

163
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,600
I wish I had as well.

164
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,928
The machine didn't discriminate.

165
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:19,570
It crashed into the stand, devastating spectator and fighter alike.

166
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,309
It was a slaughter.

167
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,210
And how did the battle in the Sun Ring come to an end?

168
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,759
Talanah's father climbed atop a Behemoth and with one well-placed spear, destroyed it.

169
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,649
Just as a second knocked him to his death.

170
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,424
Her brother and the others fought this second Behemoth, falling one by one,

171
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,720
as they put themselves between the beast and the stands.

172
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,179
And so we and the spectators were saved.

173
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:50,990
Those who had once cheered for their deaths
thanked the dying men for their very lives.

174
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,700
What a brave end.

175
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,850
And how terrible that no one speaks of it.

176
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,639
Be careful out there.

177
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,690
Thank you.

178
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,250
I should be on my way.

179
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,340
Keep hunting, Thrush!

180
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,559
[Carja merchant]
…stopping when you're in the thick of it.

181
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,280
[Carja noble]
The Vanguard serve the Carja, whether they like it or not.

182
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,250
[Oseram merchant]
There's plenty of work here…

183
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,350
[Carja merchant]
Let's have a chat.

184
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:42,049
[Carja merchant]
No, a colourful discussion.

185
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,950
[Carja guard]
Don't let your guard down.

186
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,049
[Carja guard]
I was a guard under the last king…

187
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:27,450
[Carja guard]
It's not what I imagined when I was a boy, but it's decent work…

188
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,450
[Erend]
I've sent a messenger to The Claim to let everyone know.

189
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,820
[Avad]
If there's anything you or your clan need for her arrangements, you need but ask.

190
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,110
[Erend]
There'll be time for all of that later.

191
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,779
Aloy, I'm glad you're back.

192
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,450
I'm at a loss about Ersa.

193
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,342
To learn she lives then lose that hope seems cruel.

194
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,850
She wouldn't want us to waste time talking.

195
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,950
She'd want us to find Dervahl.

196
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,684
She said he raved about smoke darkening the sun.

197
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:11,159
Tell him what you found in his papers.

198
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:12,350
A letter.

199
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,939
It mentioned a shipment of Blaze being sent to a warehouse here.

200
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,539
Only it wasn't addressed to Dervahl.

201
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:20,658
The name was Aelund Forgeman.

202
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,610
Does that mean anything to you?

203
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,549
Uh, sounds familiar.

204
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,549
Yes, a landlord.

205
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,159
The Oseram have been buying up buildings across the city,
including one under that name.

206
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,909
Let me think, it's by the edge of the mesa, near the temple.

207
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,889
Used to be a shop, but it could serve as a warehouse.

208
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,881
If Dervahl used the name is an alias to buy it, he might even be there now.

209
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,399
I'll round up my men.

210
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,070
I'll meet you there.

211
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,741
Erend, wait.

212
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:55,149
Remember that no-one hates Dervahl more than your own tribe.

213
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,850
The clans would give up much to obtain him.

214
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,969
Take him alive so you can haggle over him?

215
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,690
You can't be serious!

216
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,099
Our security depends on keeping the peace.

217
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,150
If the opportunity presents itself, take him alive.

218
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,538
Consider that a command.

219
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,369
Grr!

220
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,660
Aloy, a moment, please.

221
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:28,059
When we spoke, Erend didn't wish to dwell on the details of Ersa's death.

222
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,250
Understandable, of course.

223
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:38,184
But now that they've been left to my imagination,
those details are all I can think about.

224
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,890
You were there.

225
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,259
Did she suffer?

226
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,759
She's not the one who's suffering now.

227
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,349
You are.

228
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,450
She died before you could say goodbye.

229
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,160
Is it that obvious?

230
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,549
You're right.

231
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,549
I'm dwelling on my pain.

232
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,049
Not just hers.

233
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,410
She wasn't worried about her pain.

234
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,058
She was worried about her brother, and she was worried about you.

235
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,000
Thank you Aloy.

236
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,079
All that matters is that we catch her killer before he strikes again.

237
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,190
How much like her you sound.

238
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,299
You are correct, of course.

239
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,645
Find Dervahl and bring him before me.

240
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,450
He will answer for his crimes.

241
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,759
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods.

242
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,044
[Carja merchant]
Could you spare a moment to speak of the finer things?

243
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,739
[Vilgund]
Able bodied adventurers!

244
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,453
[Vilgund]
Preferably with no friends or family, but I'm not choosy.

245
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,139
[Erend]
This is the place.

246
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,349
You home Dervahl? I got a surprise for you!

247
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,869
[Aloy]
Blaze.

248
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,690
[Erend]
Is it a bomb? Doesn't look too big.

249
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,269
[Aloy]
Big enough to kill us.

250
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,700
[Erend]
All right, I'll shut up.

251
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,170
It's a bomb, alright.

252
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,759
If I try to take it apart, a booby trap will set it off.

253
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,619
It must be leaking from something upstairs.

254
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,789
[Erend]
That's a lot of Blaze.

255
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:20,119
[Aloy]
If that bomb downstairs goes off, it'll be just what Dervahl promised.

256
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,990
Smoke will darken the sun as the city goes up in flames.

257
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,856
If we can get rid of it somehow, the blast will be much smaller.

258
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,819
It looks like a wooden bracket, not very strong.

259
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,368
Help me push this out.

260
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:52,450
Okay.

261
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:53,278
Brute force.

262
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,450
I'm good at that.

263
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,119
What'll it do?

264
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,259
Save the city, I hope.

265
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,608
But when the Blaze falls, run for it.

266
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,639
Because the booby trap on the bomb downstairs is gonna get set off.

267
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,038
Uh, will we survive?

268
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,338
Probably not.

269
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,579
Now push!

270
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,200
We did it!

271
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,190
Dervahl's best shot and Meridian's still standing.

272
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,160
This isn't over, Dervahl said he'd make Avad watch.

273
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,390
No way!

274
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,549
To do that he'd have to get into the palace, and that's too heavily guarded.

275
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,849
Get back there just to be sure.

276
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,538
I'm going to look around.

277
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,559
Maybe Dervahl's men left something behind when they planted that bomb.

278
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:50,370
I got it, don't worry.

279
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,609
He tries for the palace, he's finished.

280
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,170
Boot tracks, with just a bit of Blaze in them.

281
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,000
[Carja outlander]
Hope no-one was inside the warehouse when it blew.

282
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,069
[Vilgund]
Can I interest you in a reasonable share of a lucrative opportunity?

283
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,849
[Carja guard]
Did the Nora have something to do with the explosion?

284
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,558
[Carja outlander]
Call the guards! There could be explosions elsewhere.

285
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,000
[Carja merchant]
What happened?

286
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,220
[Carja merchant]
I haven't heard a blast like that since the liberation.

287
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,575
[Carja merchant]
Everyone needs a splash of colour in their lives.

288
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,333
[Carja merchant]
Come, let's talk it over.

289
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,868
[Carja outlander]
Blasted Shadow Carja, traitors and backstabbers…

290
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:04,787
[Carja outlander]
There's smoke rising from the edge of the mesa!

291
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,349
[Carja outlander]
Are we under attack?

292
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,412
[Carja artisan]
Praise the sun! The ceasefire seems to be holding.

293
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,549
The tracks lead inside.

294
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,160
Another one of Dervahl's hideouts?

295
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,648
This must be where Dervahl assembled the detonator.

296
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,049
He tunnelled through the wall!

297
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,049
Dervahl did find a way into the palace.

298
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,230
Dervahl!

299
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,369
Keep that for later.

300
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,880
Look at you, Avad.

301
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,069
The wriggling runt of a maniac king!

302
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,489
You robbed me of my right to kill your father.

303
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,639
So I'll have to settle for you.

304
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,029
I'm going to enjoy watching the Carja burn,
even more because you'll be watching with me.

305
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,299
Say goodbye to Meridian, Avad.

306
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,190
Breathe in the stench, and choke on the ashes.

307
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,950
Something's wrong.

308
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,430
It didn't, I didn't hear anything.

309
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,049
There's a bit of smoke rising from the mesa's edge.

310
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,470
No! It should be a firestorm, not some belch from a charcoal burner.

311
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,523
What's this? Oh.

312
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,824
You must be the Nora who bushwhacked my camp.

313
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:47,409
And disabled your bomb.

314
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,689
[Dervahl]
Did you now?

315
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:54,000
[Dervahl]
Well, bomb or no bomb, I'm going to splatter that throne with blood.

316
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,319
First yours, then Avad's.

317
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,162
Look out, it's her!

318
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,549
Why does Avad always have his ladies do the fighting?

319
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
It's not over yet, Nora.

320
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:45,007
Any good Oseram tinker will tell you: always have a third plan.

321
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,980
Okay…

322
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,839
I hope you like fighting these things because there's more on the way.

323
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,559
Keep quiet now.

324
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,409
I can't spare the weight.

325
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:09,449
As much as I wish Ersa was here to kill you, I don't mind doing it for her.

326
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,539
Go ahead, I'm not afraid.

327
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:16,150
Except that knowing you, Erend, you'll screw it up!

328
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,250
I know what you are afraid of.

329
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,010
Going back to Mainspring in chains.

330
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,539
Every clan in The Claim wants you dead, and they know how to make it hurt.

331
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,658
They'll even bid for the privilege.

332
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,128
It's just like you to get someone else to do your killing.

333
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,814
Shut up! You're at the Sun-King's mercy now.

334
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,710
Aloy.

335
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,539
To say you have my gratitude feels woefully insufficient.

336
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,039
You saved my life.

337
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,739
You saved Meridian.

338
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:42,539
And because of you, there will be justice for Ersa's murder.

339
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,449
We can mourn her knowing the truth without painful uncertainty.

340
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,367
Were you and Ersa, you know…?

341
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:56,967
I suppose it's obvious how I feel, how I felt, about her.

342
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,829
She didn't just give me advice.

343
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,329
She gave me strength.

344
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,739
But we couldn't be together.

345
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,170
Relations between the Carja and Oseram in Meridian were unsteady as it was.

346
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,650
A union of the Sun-King and an Oseram warrior
would have led to open revolt in the city.

347
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,639
And probably war with the clans.

348
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,650
Did anyone know?

349
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,658
Only one. Dervahl.

350
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,829
He wanted Ersa, but she rejected him.

351
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,880
And so jealousy became yet another of his hateful motivations.

352
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,380
What a waste.

353
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,829
Dervahl was a brilliant man.

354
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,460
I wonder what he would have accomplished if it weren't for my father's cruelty.

355
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,329
It's time for me to go.

356
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,936
I will be forever grateful to you, Aloy.

357
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:51,590
It's hard to imagine where we'd be without you.

358
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,829
And I don't want to try.

359
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,940
I hope you will consider staying in Meridian.

360
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,628
Thank you for the offer.

361
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,550
But I've got a long way to go before I find what I'm looking for.

362
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,400
And it's gonna take me far from Meridian.

363
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:11,599
Remember that you're always welcome here.

364
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,630
I hope that today is just a sunrise for us.

365
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,440
Not a goodbye.

366
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,929
Why do you want me to stay in Meridian?

367
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,539
I would think that would be obvious.

368
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,670
Not to me.

369
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,489
Well, to start with, you kept the city from going up in flames.

370
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,030
You're strong, shrewd, and capable.

371
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,760
I could use someone like you at my side.

372
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,449
It might be worth taking a moment to examine what you just said.

373
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,309
You just lost Ersa.

374
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:55,539
A woman who stood at your side and could
easily be described as strong, shrewd, and capable.

375
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,670
It's pretty clear how you felt about her.

376
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,678
And now you're asking me to take her place?

377
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,417
Is this a job offer or a proposition?

378
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:09,429
By the Sun, you do indeed share much with Ersa.

379
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,789
Including a withering eye for foolishness.

380
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,070
Please accept my apologies.

381
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:20,820
Seems I'm getting ahead of myself.

382
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,268
I need some time to resolve my feelings.

383
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:31,630
I hope you find what you're after Aloy, and if need be I will come to your aid.

384
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,969
As sure as the Sun's rising.

385
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,079
Aloy.

386
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,320
I was just thinking about Ersa.

387
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,128
She would've killed Dervahl on the spot, I know it.

388
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:12,519
That's why she went out to meet him in the first place, to put him down.

389
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,130
But she also told me to grow up.

390
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,808
I gotta admit it burned a little when she said that.

391
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,320
But I'm trying to take it to heart.

392
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:30,179
And I guess growing up means putting what you should do
in front of what you want to do, right?

393
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,827
You're asking me? I'm pretty sure you're older.

394
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:37,369
Yeah, but I don't act like it, do I?

395
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,480
You did with Dervahl.

396
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,260
Don't give me too much credit.

397
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:44,389
Part of me still wants to wait for a quiet moment and wring his neck.

398
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:47,818
Yeah, but you won't, because you're a good captain.

399
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:49,130
Come on, stop.

400
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,960
You're gonna make me tear up.

401
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,409
So after all this, what's next for Erend Vanguardsman?

402
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:58,174
Heading back to The Claim for a while.

403
00:41:58,174 --> 00:42:02,610
I'll get in touch with my clan and we'll lay Ersa to rest properly.

404
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,510
Like how she would have wanted.

405
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,920
And by that I mean less chit-chat, more drinking.

406
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,811
What do you think the Oseram will do to Dervahl?

407
00:42:12,811 --> 00:42:16,219
First off, they'll argue about it for a long time.

408
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,110
But whatever they come up with, it won't be quick.

409
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:22,920
I can live with that.

410
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:28,920
In fact, I might just drop by his cell under the Sun Ring to remind him what's coming.

411
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,019
Well…

412
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,510
I know, you got to go.

413
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,179
Killers to track, machines to master, all before breakfast.

414
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,920
You know what?

415
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,510
When we met, I thought I was a big shot talking to
a pretty girl hidden away in the middle of nowhere.

416
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,750
Now I see that I was just lucky to get a minute of your time.

417
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,530
Try not to forget about me while you're out there changing the world.

418
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,559
I'll always have a minute for you.

419
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,610
Maybe even two.

420
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,110
Two? Huh, she likes me.

421
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:57,710
[Carja guard]
 [yawn] No, I'm awake and alert.

422
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,009
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

423
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,505
[Carja merchant]
I have a matter of grace and beauty I would like to discuss with you.

424
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,898
[Carja merchant]
You'll regret not stopping when you're in the thick of it.

425
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,530
[Oseram worker]
Wheel turning all day. By the forge, I believe I've earned a drink or two!

426
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,789
[Carja merchant]
You won't find better wares.

427
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:29,410
[Carja merchants]
- Don't pass up these goods!
- You won't find better wares.

428
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:39,800
[Carja noble]
My family might still be alive and you're going to stand here and do nothing?

429
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,597
[Carja guard]
We've lost a dozen patrols beyond the valley. Our orders are clear, no more.

430
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,619
[Carja guard]
Freeholds were warned.

431
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,016
[Carja noble]
You're talking about orders. I'm talking about lives!

432
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,658
[Carja guard]
That's what the orders are for, to save lives.

433
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:55,989
[Carja guard]
Good day, citizen.
