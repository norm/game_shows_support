1
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,475
The lesson lives within the question, Aloy.

2
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,355
For years, you've trained to win the Proving.

3
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,945
But only for yourself.

4
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:32,185
As a Brave, it will be your duty to fight for your tribe.

5
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,115
My tribe?

6
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,265
You said I wouldn't need them.

7
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:41,435
But I never said the tribe wouldn't need you. 

8
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:46,285
Dawn has passed.

9
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:50,615
This will be your last day in the Embrace as an outcast.

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,140
Use the time to set your mind
on the challenges before you.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,520
When it is time for you to go to Mother's Heart

12
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,825
I will be waiting for you on the way.

13
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:02,380
I understand the final lesson Rost.

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,285
Do you?

15
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,585
But if I am going to stand for something

16
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,955
it'll have to be something I believe in.

17
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:09,805
Then I hope you find it, Aloy.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,720
I hope you do.

19
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
[whistles]

20
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,180
This'll last.

21
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,300
[in distance]
Brom! It's your sister Olara!

22
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,240
It's heavy, world's growing white.

23
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,060
[in distance]
Are you out there?

24
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,640
Who are you calling out for?
Do you need help?

25
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:06,385
I have nothing against outcasts,
far from it.

26
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,935
But I shouldn't talk to you.
I don't want to get in trouble.

27
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,165
I don't see anyone else around to help.

28
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,560
I guess you're right.

29
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,145
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be callous.

30
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,825
My brother was cast out but his sentence has ended… 

31
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,525
He should have come home, but he didn't and…

32
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,600
Each day I cut a notch on the wall
so I knew Brom's sentence was over.

33
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Then I cut three more.

34
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,625
But he still hadn't come back.

35
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,000
I begged the Matriarchs to send Braves to find him

36
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,760
and all they found was a blood-soaked camp.

37
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,400
The Braves said he must be dead.

38
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
But I have to know the truth.

39
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,740
So I came out looking for him.

40
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,905
All I can think about is what might've happened.

41
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:49,375
Is he really dead?

42
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,473
Or maybe just wounded?

43
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:52,795
Is he suffering?

44
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,420
Does he need help?

45
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,520
I can't stand it not knowing.

46
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,745
Why was your brother cast out?

47
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,095
Brom was always a little different.

48
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,605
A little touched.

49
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,660
One of the hunters had a cruel heart
and never let him alone.

50
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,295
I was gone but an hour.

51
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,935
The hunter set after him like always but this time…

52
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,520
Brom struck back with a rock
and split the man's skull.

53
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,460
Spirits made him do it he said.

54
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,565
Whispers of the Forgotten.

55
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:24,840
What do you mean "Forgotten"?

56
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,595
All-Mother curses blasphemers who won't repent.

57
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:29,395
Banishing them from Her eternal memory.

58
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,235
Those lost spirits are the Forgotten.

59
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
Brom used to say they spoke to him,
told him to do things.

60
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,020
It was such a burden for him
and there was nothing I could do to help.

61
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
I'll do what I can to find your brother.

62
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,595
You will?

63
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:47,765
Then let me come with you, I won't be a bother.

64
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,365
I know how to stay out of sight.

65
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,275
I'm faster on my own.

66
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,855
If that is how it must be.

67
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,855
Just find him then.

68
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,500
Please.

69
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,495
This must be Brom's camp.

70
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:11,485
Better clear out those Watchers.

71
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,480
Blood but no body.

72
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
There's gotta be more to this.

73
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:03,035
Looks like a few drops of blood
lead away from the camp.

74
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,560
Whose knife is this?

75
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Did someone attack Brom with it?

76
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Looks like more blood leading away from here.

77
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,040
There, a bucket.

78
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,785
Did someone bring the blood to the camp?

79
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,260
The trail of blood ends here.

80
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,780
But whoever left it must've also left tracks.

81
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,000
Snow. It's not getting any warmer out here.

82
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,880
Got one!

83
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,815
That's … twisted.

84
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:14,345
I wonder if the blood from the camp
came from this boar?

85
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,205
If Brom did this…

86
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:19,615
why does he want people to think he's dead?

87
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,785
And why desecrate the shrine?

88
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,500
Hmm, what are those Scrappers picking at?

89
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,820
Looks like it was a Watcher.

90
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,860
Whoever I'm following made short work of it.

91
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,640
If it's Brom, he definitely knows
how to handle a spear.

92
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,155
Someone looted these supplies.

93
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,240
Brom was an outcast for a long time.

94
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
Why take food and gear now?

95
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,395
It's the supplies from the cache.

96
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:25,895
Why would they take them
and then just throw them away?

97
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,015
[in distance]
I'll kill myself!

98
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:51,665
[in distance]
I'll kill myself before I hurt her!

99
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:05,405
[in distance]
I won't listen!

100
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:08,485
[in distance]
Aaah! Not until you promise.

101
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,495
[in distance]
She's my sister! My sister!

102
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:25,715
[in distance]
I need to protect her.

103
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,255
I will, I'll kill myself.

104
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,325
I'll kill myself before I hurt her.

105
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:41,235
You? You're not a spirit.

106
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,100
What do you want?

107
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,340
I want you to step away from the edge Brom.

108
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,460
No!

109
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,165
Leave me alone!

110
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:51,395
Can't you see I need time to think?

111
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,460
How am I supposed to think
when everybody is shouting at me?

112
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,760
So many voices to listen to.

113
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,935
Must make your head hurt.

114
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:05,005
I promise my voice will be soft and soothing.

115
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,265
A soft voice like Olara's.

116
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,215
It's been so long.

117
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,285
Years.

118
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:14,045
Yes.

119
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,720
Yes, I … I will listen.

120
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,940
That's better.

121
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,625
Now tell me what's troubling you?

122
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,765
Spirits of the Forgotten.

123
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,695
Souls cursed by the All-Mother.

124
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,680
Their voices never let me be.

125
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,760
They want me to do things.

126
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,660
Hurt people.

127
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,760
If I go back to the Nora they might make me hurt Olara.

128
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,860
And I'll kill myself before I let that happen.

129
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,480
Do you have to listen to the spirits Brom?

130
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,305
They're speaking to me right now.

131
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,545
Always with me.

132
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,895
They take care of me. Keep me company.

133
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,355
Help me, except when they scream.

134
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,795
Like when that hunter knocked me down.

135
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,235
"Crush his skull with a rock!" they said.

136
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,940
And I did.

137
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,960
Brom! You're alive!

138
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,835
All-Mother be praised!

139
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,675
I'm sorry I followed you.

140
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,475
But I had to make sure he was alright.

141
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:15,615
No! No no no no no! No!

142
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,375
Please sister, I can't protect you!

143
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:21,475
I need no protection from you Brom.

144
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,525
How can you be certain?

145
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,755
The voices he hears call for blood,
even yours.

146
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:29,155
But surely he wouldn't hurt his own sister?

147
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:31,535
I've taken care of him since I was six.

148
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:34,105
Brom isn't ready to return to the Nora.

149
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,925
But I don't think he'll hurt you, Olara.

150
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
There's a place where I can stay.

151
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,300
A cave on All-Mother Mountain.

152
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,965
I suppose you could visit me there?

153
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,055
So long as I'm strong.

154
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,725
You will be Brom.

155
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:48,255
I'll help you.

156
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:52,445
Thank you, Aloy. I'll take care of him now.

157
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,965
May you walk in All-Mother's eternal memory.

158
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:58,475
And may the Forgotten leave you be.

159
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
I'll find a use for you.

160
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,255
Keep quiet now.

161
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,340
[in distance]
I need to speak to you.

162
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,560
[in distance]
I'm injured, I need your help.

163
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,225
You want to talk to an outcast?

164
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:08,495
I'm desperate for help.
Whatever the consequences.

165
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,740
You know the Matriarchs might cast you out
for speaking to me, don't you?

166
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,160
I don't care.

167
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,280
What's the problem then?
Trouble with your leg?

168
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:19,935
Forget about me, it's my daughter Arana.
She's in danger.

169
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:23,025
She went after a Scrapper up near Mother's Cradle.

170
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,000
I fear for her life.

171
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,740
Why would your daughter hunt a Scrapper on her own?

172
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,060
It's my fault.

173
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:32,015
I went after it first, and it tore up my leg.

174
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,840
I barely got away,
and I left a spear impaled in the machine.

175
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,300
That spear was made by Edena, my mate.

176
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,660
Who died last year.

177
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:45,495
It means everything to Arana.

178
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:48,035
She went after the Scrapper to get it back.

179
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,265
I'll accept any punishment if it means she's safe.

180
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,640
Please. Help me set things right.

181
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,520
I'll do what I can to help your daughter.

182
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Make sure she's alright.

183
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm begging you.

184
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,280
That must be Arana.

185
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,900
Sounds like she's in trouble.

186
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,440
[in distance]
I'm stuck up here!

187
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,520
[in distance]
I can't get down! Help!

188
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,880
[in distance]
Can I talk to you for a minute?

189
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,020
[in distance]
I just want to thank you.

190
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,960
Thank you.

191
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,840
I thought those watchers were going to tear me apart.

192
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
Your father sent me after you.

193
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,280
It's time to go home.

194
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,635
I figured.

195
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,460
But I can't go back until I get
my mother's spear from that Scrapper!

196
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,220
That spear must mean a lot to you.

197
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,680
My mother made it not long before she died.

198
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,960
I can't believe my father lost it.

199
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,940
He didn't mean to.
Scrappers are dangerous.

200
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,200
I know.

201
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:15,525
I just can't stand the idea that it might be gone forever.

202
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:18,215
Your father is worried sick about you.

203
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,520
He gets worried if I go ten steps to relieve myself in the bushes.

204
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,440
He just…
He doesn't want to lose you Arana.

205
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:26,955
I know.

206
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:30,045
But I do wish he wouldn't yell at me so much.

207
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,655
How did you wind up in that tree?

208
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,580
I tracked the Scrapper to Mother's Cradle.

209
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,000
Caught a glimpse of it too,

210
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,140
but then a Watcher saw me and called his pack.

211
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,220
By All-Mother, I'm just not a good enough
hunter to get that spear back am I?

212
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,500
I'll look for your spear.

213
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,940
You will? Oh thank you!

214
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,180
Go find your father.

215
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,840
His leg gave out while he was searching for you,
just south of Mother's Heart.

216
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Oh no!

217
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,860
Okay, I'll go to him right away!

218
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Thanks again.

219
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:52,605
Arana's trail ends here.

220
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:54,835
Must be where she saw the Scrapper.

221
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,695
If I follow its tracks I should be able to find that spear.

222
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:21,585
Mother's Cradle.

223
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,245
The trail ends here.

224
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,155
I'll bet it crossed the river.

225
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:38,965
Better check the other side.

226
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,695
There! Time to get that spear.

227
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,605
A well-made weapon.

228
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,775
Arana will be happy to have it back.

229
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,340
What is it now?

230
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,780
Always a pleasure doing business.

231
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,840
I guess that concludes our business.

232
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,280
All right. Good luck in the Proving.

233
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,785
Blessing of All-Mother and all that.

234
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,900
Let's do this!

235
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:25,405
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

236
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:22,535
Back to your business.

237
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,600
Gonna need this.

238
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,100
[in distance]
All-Mother be praised!

239
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
[in distance]
Aloy's back with the spear.

240
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:25,115
First you send Arana back to me.

241
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,660
And now you've got the spear.

242
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,780
When I first called out to you for help,

243
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,040
I didn't even know if you'd speak to me.

244
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:34,020
I'm glad you did.

245
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,525
Me too.

246
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,925
I can't believe you got the spear back!

247
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,480
Your mother knew how to craft them.

248
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,540
It's of exceptional make.

249
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:44,480
I'll never be the crafter she was,

250
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,500
but she did pass along a few tricks.

251
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,080
I'd be happy to take a look at your spear.

252
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,220
Thank you.

253
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:53,715
It sounds like she was special.

254
00:49:54,645 --> 00:49:57,025
I'm sorry for your loss.

255
00:49:57,025 --> 00:50:01,125
Because of you I still have the spear
to remember her by.

256
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:04,205
You didn't have to help us but you did.

257
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:06,515
She would've admired that.

258
00:50:07,415 --> 00:50:09,985
Thank you, Aloy.
For everything.
