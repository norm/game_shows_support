1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,156
Elisabet told Ted Faro she was headed for a place called
"U.S. Robot Command" to tell people about Zero Dawn.

2
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,949
The place still exists as a ruin.

3
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,139
The Oseram call it the Grave-Hoard.

4
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:36,919
"Grave-Hoard"? Cheery name.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,988
You'll find it in the eastern mountains,
buried under the tangled coils of a Metal Devil.

6
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:44,609
Or a BOR7 Horus rather, as we're learning to call them.

7
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,549
I'll contact you when you get there.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,350
I can't wait.

9
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,680
Ugh, Eclipse.

10
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,890
[Sylens, through Focus]
I'm not showing any Focuses at that location.

11
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,308
[Sylens, through Focus]
Shouldn't be anything you can't handle on your own.

12
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,400
[Sylens, through Focus]
Carry on.

13
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,099
[Aloy]
Thanks.

14
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,937
On my own, alright.

15
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,150
Got their attention!

16
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:45,000
The Grave-Hoard, in the shadow of a Metal Devil. Great.

17
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,550
[Eclipse]
I'm going in!

18
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,350
That does it.

19
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,490
Time to take a look around the room.

20
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,970
"Operation Enduring Victory" — what did that mean?

21
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,190
Whatever it was, doesn't seem to have turned out very well.

22
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:05,006
[sirens, sounds of battle]

23
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,669
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Say again Lieutenant?

24
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:11,750
[Lt. Murell]
It got through. Titan is through the defenses, still on approach.

25
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,093
[sirens, sounds of battle]

26
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,940
[Cpl. Acosta]
Ah, crap. A live one, and it's pissed!

27
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,994
[Sgt. Guliyev]
We got no mobility in here, it'll punch right through us.

28
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:26,467
[Lt. Murell]
We hold the hatch at all costs. Then push back out!

29
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,269
[Aloy]
A battle, frozen in ice and time.

30
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,137
[Cpl. Mills]
Looks like quite an enduring victory we put our foot in today.

31
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,289
[Lt. Murell]
Contact in 30 seconds.

32
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,212
[Cpl. Mills]
Hey, think that's enough time for Sobeck to finish Zero Dawn?

33
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,616
[laughter]

34
00:10:56,285 --> 00:11:01,753
[Cpl. Mills]
If this is really it, I got to say it's been an honour to serve beside … these tanks.

35
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:05,360
[laughter]

36
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,909
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Here it comes…

37
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:09,140
[Lt. Murell]
Brace for contact!

38
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:17,572
[sounds of battle]

39
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,693
[Aloy]
Are you getting this Sylens?

40
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,266
Sylens?

41
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,049
[Lt. Murell]
Titan inbound, same play as Akron.

42
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,403
[Lt. Murell]
Base defense locks it down.

43
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,486
[Lt. Murell]
We engage, sever the limbs, blast out the foundries.

44
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,044
[Cpl. Mills]
Another day in the life!

45
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,298
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Wrecking time, Recalls!

46
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:21,897
[Cpl. Acosta]
9th MRB on point! Hoo-rah!

47
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:39,626
[sounds of battle]

48
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,926
[Sgt. Wandari]
Yana!

49
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,976
[screams]

50
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:47,756
[sounds of battle]

51
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,360
[Aloy]
Sylens, you getting this?

52
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,710
[Sylens, through Focus]
What is it?

53
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,279
[Aloy]
All these soldiers, they died here.

54
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,950
[Sylens, through Focus]
People die all the time.

55
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,590
[Sylens, through Focus]
Keep going and find something interesting.

56
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,450
Stocking up.

57
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,450
Must have been where the soldiers slept.

58
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,600
Like the lodge in Mother's Heart, I guess.

59
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,009
[Cpl. Acosta]
Log: Third battle of California-Marine. 

60
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,570
[Cpl. Acosta]
The swarm came in from the Pacific, and…

61
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:25,073
[Cpl. Acosta]
I don't know if it was the local minutemen or the Crazy 15th,
but they'd set the garbage patch alight.

62
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:28,350
[Cpl. Acosta]
Man, the sea was on fire.

63
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,289
[Cpl. Acosta]
That stuff was… pff.

64
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,350
[Cpl. Acosta]
The first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge.

65
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:40,281
[Cpl. Acosta]
That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them
on the beaches before the swarm recalculated.

66
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:44,097
[Cpl. Acosta]
We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl.

67
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,876
[Cpl. Acosta]
Dropped buildings on them, EMP'd the grid.

68
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,759
[Cpl. Acosta]
Standard operating procedure.

69
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,980
[Cpl. Acosta]
Huh, the last time I was in California, I was five, six?

70
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,480
[Cpl. Acosta]
The light was like that vintage social net filter that was everywhere in the forties.

71
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,759
[Cpl. Acosta]
Log: First battle of the Eastern Seaboard wall.

72
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,838
[Cpl. Acosta]
Had a long run up to it.

73
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,739
[Cpl. Acosta]
This was before Cal-Mar, and projections were a lot worse for the East.

74
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,688
[Cpl. Acosta]
For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out
to some coastal 'burg to train Minutemen.

75
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,838
[Cpl. Acosta]
It was always raining, on account of Europe already being torched.

76
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,739
[Cpl. Acosta]
Block after block of prefab barracks.

77
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,629
[Cpl. Acosta]
They were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit.

78
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:38,517
[Cpl. Acosta]
The Minutemen? We ran combat drills with them in the streets where they'd lived.

79
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:42,759
[Cpl. Acosta]
Trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if they paid attention.

80
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:46,139
[Cpl. Acosta]
Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought into it.

81
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,838
[Cpl. Acosta]
Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn,
like we know something they don't.

82
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,259
[Cpl. Acosta]
I swear, the more we do this, the more like the bots we are.

83
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,160
[Cpl. Acosta]
Except they learn from every fight.

84
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,160
[Cpl. Acosta]
And us? I'm not so sure.

85
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,420
[Aloy]
What was this place?

86
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:43,514
[Lt. Murell]
Recalls, I've been instructed to remind you of Article 115 of base policy
regarding unauthorised use of processor cycles.

87
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:52,676
[Lt. Murell]
Specifically, 115c: "Any holographic simulation not directly related to operational training or efficiency."

88
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:56,549
[Lt. Murell]
Consider yourself reminded and enjoy your gaming.

89
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,334
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Thanks for the mails, you.

90
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,313
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Time goes fast on active duty.

91
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,175
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Four months with the Wreckin' Recalls, I don't know, twenty drops?

92
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:30,816
[Sgt. Guliyev]
In and out of the West Coast, fighting with these civilian enlistees.

93
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,338
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Scrappy guys and gals.

94
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,940
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Their training is basically "Here's a DEW, when you see a bot, hit it."

95
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,056
[Sgt. Guliyev]
But somehow it's all coming together.

96
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,784
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Between us and the 6th MRB, we took down a Horus at Lithium Beach.

97
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,608
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Pulled out before its buddies arrived.

98
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,849
[Sgt. Guliyev]
But to see a big one go down?

99
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,592
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I hope it make the news, honey.

100
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:55,015
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Showed everyone we're gonna have a shot at turning this around.

101
00:19:55,015 --> 00:20:01,385
[Sgt. Guliyev]
We just need to give Project Zero Dawn the time it needs,
then everything will be the way it used to be.

102
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,758
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I know it's been days, honey, I'm so sorry.

103
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:15,950
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Deployments are getting real long, and tougher every time.

104
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,250
[Sgt. Guliyev]
The swarm's getting better at predicting us.

105
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,367
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Less of us now, and we have to put in ten times the work for every one gone.

106
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:30,396
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Like a family business on hard times, only this isn't my family.

107
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,409
[Sgt. Guliyev]
It's not with you.

108
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,348
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I still try to see you, the life we had, in the eyes of the people out there.

109
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,160
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I remember when they were glad to see us, when they still had hope.

110
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,950
[Sgt. Guliyev]
It all seems to be slipping away.

111
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,849
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I don't even recognise the places we're defending.

112
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,839
[Sgt. Guliyev]
The only thing I know I'm still fighting for is you.

113
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,609
[Sgt. Guliyev]
For Zero Dawn to turn this around. Whatever the hell that is.

114
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,980
The furnishings were metal.

115
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,480
How'd they ever get comfortable?

116
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,549
It was the Metal World.

117
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,200
Guess they were used to it.

118
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,500
Hmm, just one bed.

119
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,950
Maybe their War Chief's room.

120
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,609
Red light, guess that means no power.

121
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,039
These wires must run to the power source.

122
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,750
Whatever powered this door should be close by.

123
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,180
A holographic interface. Must be some kind of code.

124
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:20,349
Maybe I should try scanning objects in this area.

125
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,440
Huh, that's informative.

126
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,625
Three power lines, three sources. That makes one.

127
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,839
[Mike]
Hey, y'all wanted to know how I remember the geotherm system reboot?

128
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,599
[Mike]
Goes like this.

129
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:21,838
[Mike]
Bird flies north in summer, east in spring, west in fall, and south in winter.

130
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:27,160
[Mike]
Didn't expect to hear nature poetry from the lips of Mike the GT Tech, now did ya?

131
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,390
[Mike]
As usual, I defy expectations.

132
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,670
That's two, one more.

133
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,660
Okay, that did it.

134
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:21,510
Tools being used, and voices. More Eclipse.

135
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,616
Must be another way in.

136
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:37,750
Ah, another power cell.

137
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,210
This should help me get to that ancient armour.

138
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,813
It's them alright.

139
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:05,396
They're not looking for answers, just weapons.

140
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,990
[Eclipse thug]
Got one, right here.

141
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,599
Keep quiet now.

142
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,480
I'd have to ditch something.

143
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,969
Forget about travelling light.

144
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,369
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Thanks for the mails, you.

145
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,179
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Time goes fast on active duty.

146
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,161
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Four months with the Wreckin' Recalls.

147
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,562
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Fighting with these civilian enlistees.

148
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:32,003
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Scrappy guys and girls, that's all coming together.

149
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:34,668
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Between us and the 6th MRB we took down a Horus.

150
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,580
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I hope it made the news, honey.

151
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,840
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Showed everyone we're turning this around.

152
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,847
[Sgt. Guliyev]
We just need to give Project Zero Dawn the time it needs.

153
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,208
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I know it's been days, honey, I'm so sorry.

154
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,147
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Deployments are getting real long.

155
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,398
[Sgt. Guliyev]
We have to put in for work for every one.

156
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,927
[Sgt. Guliyev]
Like a family business.

157
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,418
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I still see you in the eyes of the people out there.

158
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,786
[Sgt. Guliyev]
They were glad to see us, they still had hope.

159
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,139
[Sgt. Guliyev]
I'm still fighting…for…you.

160
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:17,732
[Lt. Murell]
Status report, 9th Mechanised Response Brigade,
commanding officer Lieutenant Fiona Murell.

161
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:25,353
[Lt. Murell]
Unit morale continues to be adversely impacted
by outbound engagements against the Faro Plague.

162
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:33,371
[Lt. Murell]
Especially when said engagements occur in sectors
where civilian guard enlistees have been heavily engaged.

163
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:44,922
[Lt. Murell]
The scope and nature of fatalities suffered by civilian guard
and unarmed civilians in these sectors defy description.

164
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:50,940
[Lt. Murell]
And witnessing it is generating a pervasive sense of hopelessness in the unit.

165
00:38:50,989 --> 00:39:06,239
[Lt. Murell]
Accordingly, I once again request that deployments of the 9th MRB be temporarily refocused on facilities that are mission critical to Project Zero Dawn.

166
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:15,269
[Lt. Murell]
And once again, I request an immediate update
on the status of Project Zero Dawn's timeline.

167
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,809
[Roshana Guliyev]
Ames, I don't even know if you're alive any more.

168
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:30,530
[Roshana Guliyev]
The mails I get from you, they say they're from you, but they don't sound…

169
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,035
[Roshana Guliyev]
They sound recycled.

170
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:37,908
[Roshana Guliyev]
Phrases put together, and you don't say anything about the news I pass on.

171
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:43,820
[Roshana Guliyev]
The containment zone, the rebreathers, the rioting, 1Earth.

172
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,019
[Roshana Guliyev]
What happened in the Dallas Bubble, Ames? That wasn't the robots.

173
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:53,318
[Roshana Guliyev]
They won't even give me a straight answer
when I demand to know if you're still alive.

174
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,818
[Roshana Guliyev]
They just say if your messages keep coming then you're still "operational".

175
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,929
[Roshana Guliyev]
It is not fair, Ames.

176
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,851
[Roshana Guliyev]
It's not fair that you won't be with me when the lights go out.

177
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:06,320
[Roshana Guliyev]
I love you.

178
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,019
[Aloy]
That's so sad.

179
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,008
[Roshana Guliyev]
Ames, I know I mail you too much.

180
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,159
[Roshana Guliyev]
I'm just proud of what you're doing.

181
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,005
[Roshana Guliyev]
Everyone back home is.

182
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:24,459
[Roshana Guliyev]
We got moved inland ten kilometres, just as a precaution they say.

183
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:29,110
[Roshana Guliyev]
School's still in session, so I get to keep my eye on Andras and Reggie.

184
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,918
[Roshana Guliyev]
We never know where or when you're fighting.

185
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:36,288
[Roshana Guliyev]
But when the VTOLs go over, all the kids run out and wave.

186
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,228
[Roshana Guliyev]
I believe in you.

187
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,805
[Roshana Guliyev]
I knew nothing's ever gonna be the same, but I believe in you.

188
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:44,650
[Roshana Guliyev]
I believe in us.

189
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,380
Full already.

190
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:04,597
What is this?

191
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:09,393
[Sylens, through Focus]
That? It's a map.

192
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,290
[Aloy]
A map of what?

193
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:17,034
[Sylens, through Focus]
Our world, the planet Earth, Aloy.

194
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:20,000
[Sylens, through Focus]
It's not flat like you thought.

195
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,078
[Aloy]
Why would I think that?

196
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:25,226
[Aloy]
During eclipses the shadow cast on the moon is curved.

197
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:30,767
[Aloy]
So our world is a globe, and it looks like this from a distance.

198
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,236
[Sylens, through Focus]
Look, er, we'll discuss this another time.

199
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,568
[Sylens, through Focus]
Back to the matter at hand.

200
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:41,204
[Aloy]
The Faro robots were spreading across the world, eating everything up.

201
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:45,893
[Aloy]
Somehow, Elisabet stopped them before it was too late.

202
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:47,214
[Aloy]
But how?

203
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:52,539
The Eclipse, tampering with a Metal Devil.

204
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,514
They don't think they can wake it, do they?

205
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:02,102
Watch out!

206
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:19,825
Sun in Shadow!

207
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,968
Another Khopesh. And this one can move!

208
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,565
[sighs] Then we do it the hard way. 

209
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,072
Ah, that did it.

210
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:18,618
So the soldiers long ago, they had to fight hundreds of those?

211
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:20,306
All at once!?

212
00:55:33,635 --> 00:55:35,105
I'll tuck that away.

213
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:44,772
I'll find a use for you.

214
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,960
I can't spare the weight.

215
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,913
Haha, mine now!

216
01:02:46,022 --> 01:02:48,543
[General Herres]
Thank you, Dr Sobeck, you can take a seat.

217
01:02:48,543 --> 01:02:52,117
[Military Commander 4]
Wha— you're going to thank her after what she just said?

218
01:02:52,117 --> 01:02:57,076
[General Herres]
Dr Sobeck has made the situation very clear general,
and given us an option.

219
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:59,091
[General Herres]
We should all be thanking her.

220
01:02:59,091 --> 01:03:02,369
[Military Commander 4]
It's just, I mean, my God!

221
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:04,808
[Military Commander 1]
Maybe take this discussion offline.

222
01:03:04,808 --> 01:03:07,726
[General Herres]
There's not going to be any discussion.

223
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:10,000
[General Herres]
You saw the numbers.

224
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,378
[General Herres]
Now Faro, he'll foot the bill, but his money can't buy
the time necessary to complete Zero Dawn.

225
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:17,567
[General Herres]
That…

226
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:20,357
[General Herres]
That can only be paid for in blood.

227
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:22,347
[Military Commander 3]
Oh, come on!

228
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:25,197
[Military Commander 1]
If we upgrade our fleet, crack the code somehow…

229
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:26,900
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Were you not listening!?

230
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,599
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Robots can't do the fighting for you this time.

231
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,782
[Elisabet Sobeck]
When it comes to hacking, this rogue swarm is an apex predator.

232
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:37,600
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Anything automated you throw at it, they will hijack and take over.

233
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,127
[Military Commander 2]
But this? We'd be throwing civilians into a meat grinder!

234
01:03:42,127 --> 01:03:47,755
[General Herres]
Commanders, the enemy we're facing self-replicates faster than we can kill it.

235
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:50,970
[General Herres]
And it eats biomass as fuel.

236
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:53,554
[General Herres]
Zero Dawn is all we've got.

237
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,022
[Military Commander 3]
So we put a rail gun in the hand of every civilian strong enough to carry one,
show them where the trigger is, and point them to the front?

238
01:04:04,022 --> 01:04:05,873
[Military Commander 3]
How the hell do we sell that?

239
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:10,414
[General Herres]
By giving them something to fight for: Zero Dawn.

240
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:13,634
[General Herres]
The top secret super weapons programme that will save us.

241
01:04:13,634 --> 01:04:18,700
[General Herres]
So long as humanity holds off the swarm long enough
for Dr Sobeck and her team to finish it.

242
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:23,780
[General Herres]
The file I'm sending contains the war plan for Operation: Enduring Victory.

243
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,964
[Military Commander 2]
War plan?! This is a war crime!

244
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:29,683
[General Herres]
It may be ugly, but it's something.

245
01:04:29,683 --> 01:04:31,802
[General Herres]
Consider the alternative.

246
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:40,799
[General Herres]
Dr Sobeck, I've secured use of a decommissioned orbital launch base
outside Bryce, Utah, as the Zero Dawn staging area.

247
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,921
[General Herres]
Plenty of space there. When can you get started?

248
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:47,565
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I have already mailed you a list of Alpha and Beta candidates.

249
01:04:47,565 --> 01:04:52,179
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Most are foreign nationals or subjects of corporate holdings, so extracting them…

250
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:56,441
[General Herres]
Leave that to me. You'll get your dream team, count on it.

251
01:04:57,128 --> 01:04:58,487
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Then I'll be off.

252
01:05:05,163 --> 01:05:08,548
"orbital launch base" — what is that?

253
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:10,701
What did these people do?

254
01:05:11,623 --> 01:05:13,333
What did Elisabet do?

255
01:05:35,334 --> 01:05:37,633
I'd have to leave something else behind.

256
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:52,692
[General Herres]
Dr Sobeck. As projected the Wichita salient has collapsed.

257
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,850
[General Herres]
Five Horus-class titans have broken through.

258
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:58,489
[General Herres]
We predict contact in thirty-four hours.

259
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:01,422
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Everything is in position, General.

260
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:05,477
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It took a few shortcuts to pull everything together, but…

261
01:06:05,477 --> 01:06:09,429
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Zero Dawn is functionally complete, good to go.

262
01:06:09,429 --> 01:06:12,989
[General Herres]
Then Enduring Victory served its purpose after all.

263
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:16,619
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Yes. If we'd had even one day less…

264
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,271
[General Herres]
I've sent you an encoded file, doctor.

265
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:22,112
[General Herres]
Please do me the favour of archiving it.

266
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:25,213
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I'll see what I can do.

267
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:26,243
[Elisabet Sobeck]
What is it?

268
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:27,435
[General Herres]
A brief statement.

269
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:31,413
[General Herres]
An allocution of crimes I guess you'd call it.

270
01:06:31,413 --> 01:06:33,608
[Elisabet Sobeck]
To what are you admitting guilt?

271
01:06:33,608 --> 01:06:43,576
[General Herres]
Over the past sixteen months doctor, I have presided over the greatest wholesale slaughter of military personnel and civilians in the history of…

272
01:06:44,602 --> 01:06:46,263
[General Herres]
history.

273
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:51,058
[General Herres]
Genghis Khan, Hitler, Stalin, Sorabella…

274
01:06:51,058 --> 01:06:54,650
[General Herres]
Add 'em all together they don't even come close.

275
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,968
[Elisabet Sobeck]
You didn't do the killing, general.

276
01:06:56,968 --> 01:06:59,190
[General Herres]
No, not directly.

277
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:06,811
[General Herres]
But I didn't wind up the highest ranked military commander in the United States
by resisting the automation of the armed forces.

278
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:11,735
[General Herres]
Even before the swarm, doctor, I was helping death along.

279
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:16,936
[General Herres]
So instead of letting what I've done sink into the murk, forgotten,

280
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,000
[General Herres]
I've sent a file with all the details.

281
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,857
[General Herres]
Let posterity judge my actions with clear vision.

282
01:07:23,857 --> 01:07:30,345
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I'll do as you ask, general, but you should consider
that were it not for your actions…

283
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:35,832
[Elisabet Sobeck]
…our actions, there wouldn't be any posterity to judge us.

284
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:38,397
[General Herres]
Perhaps. Dr Sobeck.

285
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:41,913
[Elisabet Sobeck]
At ease, General, and goodbye.

286
01:07:41,913 --> 01:07:43,143
[General Herres]
Hell of a thing.

287
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:00,824
Glad to be rid of that place.

288
01:08:00,824 --> 01:08:03,834
Now I just need to find the orbital launch base they talked about.

289
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:06,284
I've checked my data and located the base.

290
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:07,834
That's the good news.

291
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,600
[sighs] And the bad?

292
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,067
It's directly underneath the Citadel, the palace at Sunfall.

293
01:08:14,067 --> 01:08:17,071
The capital of the Shadow Carja.

294
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:19,034
Not exactly convenient.

295
01:08:19,034 --> 01:08:23,776
The palace is crawling with Eclipse agents, many in positions of authority.

296
01:08:23,776 --> 01:08:25,267
All of them wearing Focuses.

297
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,444
The moment they see you Hades will too.

298
01:08:27,444 --> 01:08:32,714
He'll issue another kill order, and this time
the entire Shadow Carja military will be after you.

299
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:36,443
So disable their Focuses, you've done it before.

300
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:38,002
It's not that simple.

301
01:08:38,002 --> 01:08:42,884
Too many Focuses in one place, each of them
communicating with each other and back to Hades.

302
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:44,514
A whole network of them.

303
01:08:44,514 --> 01:08:46,400
"Network" — what's that?

304
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,125
Er, imagine a vast, invisible web stretched across the land from end to end.

305
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:52,634
Connecting Focuses together.

306
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:56,634
Allowing them to communicate over vast distances instantaneously.

307
01:08:56,634 --> 01:09:01,170
Alright, so is there some way to cut the web down?

308
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,234
Hmm. Crash the network? Audacious!

309
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:11,034
Yes, there is a way, a weak point in the network.

310
01:09:11,034 --> 01:09:12,134
Point the way.

311
01:09:13,637 --> 01:09:16,143
I'll send the location data to your Focus.

312
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,369
Head there, and I'll be in touch when you're close with more directions.

313
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,690
What was Zero Dawn?

314
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,456
What sort of super weapon did Elisabet make?

315
01:09:52,839 --> 01:09:59,717
She stopped the machines but not before the world she knew,
her civilisation ended.

316
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,962
Let's hope it won't come to that again.

317
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:11,189
Now, how am I gonna get down from here?
