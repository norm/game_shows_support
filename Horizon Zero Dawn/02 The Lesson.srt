1
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,240
Rost?

2
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,820
Rost!

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,980
ROST!

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,580
Where is he?

5
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,720
Two days before the proving and he goes off without me?

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
He wouldn't do that.

7
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,860
He said we'd go hunting this morning.

8
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,460
Why isn't he here?

9
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,820
Where has he gone to?

10
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
What's he doing up there?

11
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,440
He's just standing there.

12
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,420
What's going on with him?

13
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
Aloy.

14
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
You're here.

15
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,060
When you said we were gonna go hunting

16
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,460
I didn't realise you meant I'd have to track you down.

17
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
We must speak.

18
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,380
I've been thinking about your training Aloy.

19
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
You've learned to hunt, learned to survive.

20
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,460
But I fear there's a lesson I failed to teach you.

21
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,520
Would you learn it now?

22
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,620
Of course, I'll always learn what you have to teach.

23
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,160
There's been some trouble recently.

24
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,220
It affords an opportunity to learn this lesson

25
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,380
but it will be dangerous.

26
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
You must come prepared

27
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
or you will die.

28
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Descend into the Embrace and hunt

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
until you've gathered the parts for fire arrows.

30
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
Fire arrows?

31
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
What kind of trouble are we talking about?

32
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,840
Once you have the parts, you will meet me there

33
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,119
at the gate beyond the village of Mother's Heart.

34
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,020
The north gate at the edge of the Embrace?

35
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes.

36
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Now be on your way.

37
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Is something else bothering you?

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,820
No. I'm fine.

39
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,640
Are you worrying about what happens

40
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,720
after the Proving?

41
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,940
What happens is clear.

42
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
You will be accepted as one of the tribe

43
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,600
and I will still be an outcast to be shunned.

44
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,980
Rost, even if the tribe accepts me I won't…

45
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,680
There is much to do Aloy.

46
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,020
We will discuss this later.

47
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,900
[sighs] Okay.

48
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
Uhh

49
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,980
Odd Grata might be out of food by now.

50
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,400
You could hunt a week's worth of meat for her

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,120
if you find the time.

52
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,320
Wouldn't mind if she'd say thanks just once.

53
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,580
Grata follows the law.

54
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,560
Her silence towards us is honourable, not an insult.

55
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,439
I'll go gather the parts, but i'm also gonna pay Karst a visit.

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,300
Aloy…

57
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,280
That man breaks the law every time he speaks to you.

58
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
And I'm glad he does.

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,540
I want to buy a Tripcaster and no other trader will sell to outcasts.

60
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
Stock it with ammunition then.

61
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
You'll find use for that weapon tonight.

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,460
That sounds ominous.

63
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,259
All right. See you at the north gate.

64
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,420
Something's really bothering him.

65
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,020
If he thinks I'm going to abandon him, he's wrong.

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
The Embrace.

67
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,800
My whole life I've never gone beyond this valley.

68
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,640
That'll change after the Proving.

69
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,000
Two days.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Two days until I get answers.

71
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
Two days and I'll know who she was.

72
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
And why I was cast out at birth.

73
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,460
As if there could be an excuse for that.

74
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,380
All right.

75
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,640
Time to gather the parts for some fire arrows.

76
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I should find a herd.

77
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
All-Mother.

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,479
When my name was called to the mountain

79
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,340
you did not speak it back.

80
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,320
You kept it close to your heart.

81
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,880
I know even when my belly and hands are empty

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,360
that you hold me in your embrace.

83
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
Hello Grata.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,820
All-Mother, since I was cast out

85
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,160
have I not been constant as the river flows?

86
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Have I not kept the vows as the stones do?

87
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,240
Show me your grace All-Mother

88
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
and provide for me once more.

89
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't worry Grata, I'll hunt your rabbits.

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,920
All-Mother!

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,480
I hear your voice on the wind.

92
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,460
I would count your blessings on my prayer beads,

93
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,460
but I lost them atop the eastern overlook.

94
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,458
My old bones are too worn to return.

95
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,140
So it's rabbits and your trinket you need this time.

96
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Okay, I'll find you at your camp.

97
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Calm, calm.

98
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
Snow chill. Itches.

99
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,780
Okay, Grata said her prayer beads were at the eastern overlook.

100
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,400
It's not far from here.

101
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,380
The Brave Trail up the rocks is close by.

102
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Grata may be devout but it takes strong arms to reach the overlook the fast way.

103
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,720
Explosions and shouts from outside the Embrace.

104
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,360
I wonder what's going on?

105
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,540
This looks promising.

106
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
Aha! Grata's prayer beads.

107
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
I see why she comes up here to pray.

108
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,620
It looks out to Mother's Gate.

109
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,600
You know, I wonder what bothers me more.

110
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,820
That she ignores me?

111
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,020
Or that with all her talking to All-Mother she's never lonely.

112
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Tasty.

113
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,460
More than equipped to take you on!

114
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,360
Here we go again…

115
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,100
Pass the test.

116
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Never know when I might need these.

117
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Keep that for later.

118
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,160
That'll keep my stomach quiet.

119
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,680
Time to see Karst and get a Tripcaster.

120
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,620
No-one else around, looks safe to meet.

121
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,360
My guess is he'll be waiting for me.

122
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,060
There he is, looks nervous.

123
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,540
Well, well, well.
An outcast on my doorstep.

124
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,100
All-Mother protect me.

125
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,220
Surprised you saw me the way you keep looking every other direction

126
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,560
to make sure no one's watching.

127
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,240
Careful there you'll sprain your neck.

128
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,020
It's always a pain in the neck when you show up girl,

129
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,040
one way or another.

130
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,860
Is there a reason why you're acting so cranky today?

131
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,460
Once you run the Proving and get made a brave

132
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,400
you'll deal with traders in Mother's Heart.

133
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,379
Maybe I don't like losing customers.

134
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,079
Traders who don't break the law and deal with outcasts you mean?

135
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,520
That's right. Our days of crime will be behind us. So long as you keep quiet.

136
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,360
Are you worried I'm going to tell someone that you trade with outcasts?

137
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't think you're the kind who talks…

138
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,159
…but you never know.

139
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,799
You can stop worrying.
Your secret's safe with me.

140
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,840
Yeah, that's what I figured.

141
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,500
But I don't mind hearing it.

142
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,400
The only person I've ever told about our trades is Rost.

143
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,799
Yeah, well not like he can turn me in
even if he wanted to.

144
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,600
Law and duty sort of a man that Rost.

145
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,120
I don't know how you stand it.

146
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
You really don't know why he was cast out?

147
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
I've told you, no.

148
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,940
I don't think anyone knows what he did,

149
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,960
but it must have been serious because
his term is for life.

150
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,660
Why do you take the risk trading with outcasts?

151
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Every time, you ask.

152
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,640
If a big meaningful talk is what you're after, 
move along.

153
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
It's because you used to be one, isn't it?

154
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah.

155
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,540
Got caught poking around one of the metal Ruins out beyond the Embrace.

156
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,360
Matriarchs said I was tainted and gave me five years.

157
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
What did you see in the ruins?

158
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Nothing I could make sense of.

159
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,120
After my shunning I tried living back in Mother's Heart,

160
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,820
but everyone I knew had moved on

161
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,540
and there were so many people everywhere I turned.

162
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,420
I like it better out here.

163
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,400
Last time I visited you had a Tripcaster available for trade.

164
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,760
Still got it?

165
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
I do.

166
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,940
But you need to bring me a Scrapper Lens.

167
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,520
What can I say? Special weapons don't come cheap.

168
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
Oh, I can pay.

169
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,140
Took down a Scrapper not long ago.

170
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,319
Stripped out the lens in perfect condition.

171
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,180
I'll be the judge of that. Show me.

172
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,960
Now that you've got yourself a Tripcaster,

173
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,620
practice how to use it someplace else, all right?

174
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,000
My life's exciting enough without a bunch 
of shock wire booby traps to trip over.

175
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,000
Really? Could have fooled me.

176
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
Will you be around later?
In case I want to make another trade?

177
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll be here.

178
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Same as usual bring me the parts you harvest
from any machines you hunt.

179
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,239
The better the parts, the more shards I'll pay.

180
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,799
I guess that concludes our business.

181
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,480
All right, good luck in the Proving.

182
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,779
Blessing of All-Mother and all that.

183
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,699
It's heavy, world's going white.

184
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,279
Fresh as it comes.

185
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
No turning back.

186
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,980
There's Grata, all alone with All-Mother.

187
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,580
The only way she knows.

188
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,700
Good news Grata!

189
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,200
Once again All-Mother has brought you rabbits.

190
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,599
I found your prayer beads, too.
Just try not to lose them again.

191
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,780
All-Mother, each morning I find
your tears of joy speckling the leaves.

192
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,800
Joy at the beauty of all you have made.

193
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,300
See how I cry now with you in gratitude.

194
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,980
So you'll cry for her but you won't speak to me.

195
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,280
Fine. Guess that makes you the better outcast.

196
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
Grata…

197
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
I may not be around much for a while.

198
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,839
I'm gonna run in the Proving and…

199
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
I'm not sure what's gonna happen after that.

200
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,760
All-Mother I thank you for the kindnesses you share.

201
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,240
When the Proving comes in your great wisdom,

202
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,159
may you give favour to a brave of generous heart.

203
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,640
I… think I get what you're saying.

204
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,380
Goodbye Grata for now.

205
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,820
I've got what I need.

206
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,880
Time to meet Rost at the north gate.

207
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,620
[offscreen]
Brom! It's your sister Olara!

208
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Saving these for the trail.

209
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Good … meat.

210
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,880
Aloy, you're here.

211
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
You have the fire arrows?

212
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,319
I do.

213
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,119
Those explosions and shouts beyond the embrace…

214
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
…is that the trouble you were talking about?

215
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
You will know soon enough.
Until then we wait for dark.

216
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
What can we do from in here?

217
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,579
The lesson will be taught in due time Aloy.

218
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
Until then we wait.

219
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,500
I got Odd Grata her rabbits.

220
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,040
For which she thanked All-Mother, of course.

221
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,119
It was All-Mother working through you
to bring her the rabbits.

222
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,680
You always say that but I was there and I hunted alone.

223
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,199
And you always say that and so make yourself alone.

224
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,119
I saw Karst and got that Tripcaster I was talking about.

225
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,680
I hate to think what that outlaw trader
charged for a weapon of that make.

226
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,480
It wasn't cheap, but the 'caster is worth it.

227
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
Perhaps.

228
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,660
You'll know it's worth soon enough.

229
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,319
Is something else bothering you?

230
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,560
No. I'm fine.

231
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,080
Are you worrying about
what happens after the Proving?

232
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,680
What happens is clear.

233
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,140
You will be accepted as one of the tribe
and I will still be an outcast.

234
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,520
To be shunned.

235
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,660
Rost, even if the tribe accepts me I…

236
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,400
There is much to do Aloy.

237
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
We will discuss this later.

238
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,440
Still a while ago before dark.

239
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,280
I guess I'll get some rest.

240
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,920
Good idea.

241
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,040
There'll be no time for sleep tonight.

242
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
[whistles]

243
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,340
[returned whistle from outside]

244
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,020
Opening a gate for an outcast?

245
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,300
Some who are shunned reaped honour before disgrace.

246
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,120
So much for tribal law.

247
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,680
I spoke to no one and now we must both keep silent.

248
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,240
For we are outside of the Embrace.

249
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,840
These are the true wilds Aloy.

250
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,640
With threats unlike any you have ever faced.

251
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
T hat carcass!

252
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,440
What sort of beast was that?

253
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,399
The tribe calls it a Sawtooth and it's something new.

254
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,960
Something angry.

255
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,480
Since they first started appearing 10 years ago,
they have killed many braves.

256
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Yeah.

257
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
[Rost]
Follow the path it's not far.

258
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,460
That cabin what happened to it?

259
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,200
[Rost]
A machine, that's what.

260
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,740
What sort of machine does that?

261
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,839
[Rost]
The sort of machine you're hunting now.

262
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,020
Oh. I see.

263
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,220
A Watcher carcass. I'll harvest the parts.

264
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,260
[Rost]
Watch your surroundings.

265
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,220
[Rost]
It won't be much farther now.

266
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,500
Why are we the only ones out here tonight?

267
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
Why can't the tribe's braves hunt this machine?

268
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,080
[Rost]
They did. The kills we've passed are theirs.

269
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,480
[Rost]
Tomorrow they will hunt again.

270
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,800
They won't need to.

271
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
This machine will be my kill.

272
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,220
[Rost]
Or your death if you're not careful.

273
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,000
An entire lodge wrecked.

274
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,780
By Sawtooths?

275
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,340
How many were there?

276
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,200
I didn't bring you here to answer questions Aloy.

277
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,660
I brought you here to deal with that.

278
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
It's huge!

279
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,680
How do you defeat it?

280
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,839
That will be for you to decide.

281
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,359
This hunt is yours to make Aloy. Yours alone.

282
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,179
No matter what happens I will not intervene.

283
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,800
You understand?

284
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
You are on your own.

285
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,640
I should stay out of sight.

286
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,360
I can use the tall grass to approach.

287
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,120
Okay, let's see. Where can I place my traps?

288
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,760
And now it's on!

289
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,280
I should scan it.

290
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,880
Out of ammo.

291
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,760
I should switch weapons.

292
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Hello!

293
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,780
Why did I bring you here?

294
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,999
Not to answer questions.

295
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,900
Aloy.

296
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,240
Survival requires perfection.

297
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,119
It was a test to hone my skills
against a dangerous new machine.

298
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
No. Follow.

299
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
These are Nora hunting lands.

300
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
They must be protected.

301
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,580
If you hadn't destroyed the sawtooth,

302
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,599
how many braves might it
have killed or injured tomorrow?

303
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,279
The lesson lives within the question Aloy.

304
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,839
For years you've trained to win the Proving
but only for yourself.

305
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,040
As a brave it will be your duty to fight for your tribe.

306
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,420
My tribe?

307
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
You said I wouldn't need them.

308
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,159
But I never said the tribe wouldn't need you.

309
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,540
The strength to stand alone Aloy,
is the strength to make a stand.

310
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,079
To serve a purpose greater than yourself.

311
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,620
That is the lesson you must learn.

312
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,460
And remember it after the Proving…

313
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,320
…and after I'm gone.

314
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,460
We're finished here.
Follow.
