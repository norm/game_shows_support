1
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,250
So you want these prisoners brought back?

2
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,850
No. I want them put in the earth.

3
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,878
I doubt they'll give you any choice.

4
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,599
They had their chance with the Sun-King's generosity.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,489
So now they face mine. A bounty on all their heads.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,450
If I did this for you, I need a lead on them.

7
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,572
Rasgrund we pulled out of a crack in Dusk Mesa,
where he'd been tinkering with his bombs.

8
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:47,149
And Gavan will be trying to pay his way across the lake.

9
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,799
I'd burn my palm on it.

10
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,369
Look in Brightmarket.

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,290
Never know when I might need these.

12
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,250
It's down!

13
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:57,839
Let's get this over with.

14
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,549
Ah, damn.

15
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,149
Hardly little plant. You'll help.

16
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,080
Gotta keep the upper hand.

17
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
[Bandit thug]
What's the matter, girl, scared?

18
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,359
[Bandit thug]
…for some pain.

19
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,708
[Bandit thug]
Wanna play?

20
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,139
Keep that for later.

21
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,500
Got their attention!

22
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,259
Here we go again.

23
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,849
[Rasgrund]
Ho there!

24
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,548
[Rasgrund]
I thought they'd send soldiers.

25
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,970
[Rasgrund]
The mighty Carja empire must be more strapped than I thought.

26
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,349
[Rasgrund]
How sad.

27
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,930
[Rasgrund]
No matter, bounty hunters die like the rest.

28
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,950
[Rasgrund]
Welcome to my ravine of death.

29
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,338
[Aloy]
Are you serious?

30
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:38,639
[Rasgrund]
Sadist, murderer, trap-maker. All these things.

31
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,049
[Rasgrund]
That's why they put me in that stinking hole.

32
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,038
[Rasgrund]
I'm curious.

33
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,949
[Rasgrund]
I don't suppose those Behemoths
I called to the prison killed Janeva?

34
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,459
[Aloy]
You're gonna be disappointed.

35
00:18:54,459 --> 00:19:00,099
[Rasgrund]
Yup, that's why I have my toys. To distract me from the pain.

36
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,436
[Rasgrund]
Still alive?

37
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:12,859
[Aloy]
Yes!

38
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,660
[Rasgrund]
Oh, you're a trickster.

39
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,838
[Rasgrund]
Careful now, don't slip.

40
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,003
[Rasgrund]
Not yet, little acrobat.

41
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,500
[Rasgrund]
Whoopsie!

42
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,450
[Rasgrund]
But you're not on fire yet!

43
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,884
[Rasgrund]
Persistent aren't you?

44
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,238
[Rasgrund]
You got me. No more traps.

45
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,450
[Rasgrund]
Tell Janeva I'll be a good boy from now on.

46
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,348
You expect me to believe that?

47
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,759
What's in your hand?

48
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,549
Oh, this? Oh just a little… oops.

49
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,569
I guess he died doing what he loved.

50
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:24,660
Stocking up.

51
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,574
[whistle]

52
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,118
No turning back! 

53
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,789
Another hit in.

54
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,349
I'll tuck that away.

55
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,099
Some kind of figurine?

56
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:25,960
I think it's Banuk.

57
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,217
Now they're hunting me.

58
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:42,851
[whistle]

59
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,406
Sun's headed for the west.

60
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,167
[Carja villager]
The Sun-King owes his life to an outlander.

61
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,688
[Carja villager]
What a strange time we live in.

62
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,000
If this Gavan came through here,
the inn seems like a good place to start asking.

63
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,170
As the Sun is my witness, never had a Nora in my house.

64
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,150
What about a man named Gavan?

65
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:44,328
Umm, no.

66
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,401
Can't say I've heard that name.

67
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:50,000
But we're a trading town, get a lot of people through.

68
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,210
All kinds I'm sure, like ones who don't want to be followed.

69
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:56,731
I never heard of your Gavan.

70
00:45:56,731 --> 00:46:00,168
If he's trouble, well, can't say I'm sorry.

71
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:04,090
Now I have things to be doing Nora girl, if you don't mind.

72
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:07,300
Well, he wasn't suspicious at all.

73
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,840
Time to take a look around.

74
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:57,078
[Carja villager]
How did he get so close to the Sun-King?

75
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,699
[Carja villager]
The Oseram guard will be blaming their shadows for their mistakes.

76
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,190
Hello, Gavan. You wouldn't have gotten this off without help.

77
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,289
You didn't make for the harbour.

78
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,090
And you didn't go alone.

79
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,320
Clever!

80
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,710
So, did Gavan find his friends or his enemies?

81
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,949
Suppose they're all the same to me.

82
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,048
Looks like they're not happy to see him back.

83
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:29,409
[Hashiv]
Don't you pass out, Gavan! I'm not done with you.

84
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:34,958
[Hashiv]
If you can break out of Sunstone Rock,
you can take a bit of knife play, can't you?

85
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,179
[Hashiv]
You didn't break out. You're a snitch.

86
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:40,530
[Hashiv]
Come to bring Meridian down on us.

87
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,980
[Hashiv]
This is my operation now, so I have to make a show of you.

88
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,820
[Hashiv]
Hey!

89
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,420
[Bandit thug]
Get down or get shot!

90
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,269
So they woke up.

91
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,211
They sent you to take me back to Sunstone?

92
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:00,969
Not to take you back.

93
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,920
Huh, well, Hashiv's done your job for you.

94
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,280
Janeva said you were a smuggler only for the shards.

95
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:11,334
Is that true?

96
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,848
I could tell you anything.

97
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:17,659
A sick mother, or I did it for the poor children.

98
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,023
But you'd be lying.

99
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:21,420
In the year I spent in a cage,

100
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,267
all I regretted was killing that guard because it got me caught.

101
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:28,059
You can take that back to Sunstone Rock.
