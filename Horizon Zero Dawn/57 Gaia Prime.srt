1
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:26,350
SYLENS: So … you're even more extraordinary than I thought.

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,608
ALOY: I never had a mother.

3
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,123
SYLENS: What are you talking about? You had two, a dead woman and a machine.

4
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:40,758
ALOY: I'm not a person, I'm an instrument, manufactured by a machine.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,326
ALOY: Born in destruction and fire.

6
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,339
SYLENS: To quench the flames and heal the world.

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,939
SYLENS: How tragic to learn you're a person of towering importance.

8
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,439
SYLENS: It seems you have a destiny to fulfil.

9
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,259
SYLENS: So when you're done feeling sorry for yourself, go to the Bitter Climb.

10
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,450
SYLENS: I'll be waiting above in Gaia Prime's ruins.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,939
ALOY: Gaia's sacrifice, it did this?

12
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:27,730
ALOY: Cracked the inside of the mountain like it was an egg?

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,100
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: Yes, yes, quickly now.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,250
SYLENS: I've prepared the way ahead for you.

15
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,349
ALOY: So you've been in here before?

16
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,828
SYLENS: To a point. You'll see.

17
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,740
ALOY: You made a climbing path for me,
but left an army of machines for me to deal with?

18
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,888
SYLENS: Since when were machines any obstacle for you?

19
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,608
SYLENS: If you could fly, I wouldn't have bothered with a climbing path either.

20
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,240
ALOY: Don't look down, don't look down.

21
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
ALOY: Ugh, dammit!

22
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,350
ALOY: This is exactly the kind of place I expected to find you in, Sylens.

23
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,550
SYLENS: Thank you.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,379
SYLENS: It's one of many workshops I have constructed over the years.

25
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,939
For years I tried to get through this hatch.

26
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,750
I drilled, I burned, I blasted.

27
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,810
But we both know that you won't have any trouble getting through.

28
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,399
You make it sound like I should apologise.

29
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,579
Not at all.

30
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,560
It never occurred to me that the way through
would not be with force, but with a key.

31
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,199
A key in human form.

32
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,067
The failure of imagination was mine, not yours.

33
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,800
Looks like you've spent a lot of time here.

34
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,050
Nineteen years ago, a great explosion destroyed this mountain.

35
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,107
Gaia's death, your birth.

36
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,386
The echo could be heard as far as The Claim.

37
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,750
Ash darkened the skies.

38
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,449
How they fretted in Meridian as they tried to read this omen.

39
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,009
The crater burned for weeks, but when it cooled
I was the first to behold what lay within.

40
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,550
Over time the machines closed ranks to protect it. Useful.

41
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:49,267
Soon no-one dared to come here, except me.

42
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:56,052
In her message Gaia said we could restore her,
but after seeing the damage, how could that be?

43
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,850
She said any effort to repair her must come after Hades is destroyed.

44
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,379
I concur.

45
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,100
Rebuilding the terraforming system now
might allow Hades to use it as a weapon.

46
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,156
Because of Gaia's sacrifice it has been forced
to search for means that are less … convenient.

47
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,389
But do you think it's even possible to restore Gaia?

48
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,240
You know what the cauldrons of capable of.

49
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,180
How they fabricate any technology necessary to create a machine.

50
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,310
By the same principle, it should be possible
to replicate every technology necessary to repair Gaia.

51
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,539
But that would take years.

52
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,349
And we're counting the time we have left by the hour.

53
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,649
I thought you might actually be here this time, actually here.

54
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,325
Why? My presence is unnecessary.

55
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,379
You don't need my help to pass through this door.

56
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,660
You were the one born to do this, not me.

57
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,160
When you find the master override, you will gain the power to defeat Hades.

58
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,649
Everything depends on you.

59
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,016
COMPUTER: Genetic identity confirmed. Entry authorised.

60
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:15,764
COMPUTER: Greetings Doctor Sobeck, you are cleared to proceed.

61
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,490
SYLENS: Mind your footing.

62
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,595
MARGO SHĔN: Logging arrivals; Shĕn, Margo.

63
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:20,000
TRAVIS TATE: Welcome to frozen hell, population 10.

64
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,439
MARGO SHĔN: 11 counting Gaia.

65
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,609
TRAVIS TATE: Don't count your chicken embryos before they incubated, hun.

66
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,350
TRAVIS TATE: She's still firing up.

67
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,790
TRAVIS TATE: Be a while before you eat that omelette.

68
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,891
MARGO SHĔN: I'm vegan, Travis. You think we'd worked
in the same secret base long enough for you to notice.

69
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:38,239
TRAVIS TATE: We weren't scheduled to shack up here for another three weeks.

70
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,038
TRAVIS TATE: You realise I just lost 350kg of pre-code smut comics in transit?

71
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,479
MARGO SHĔN: Wait, actual physical media?

72
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,852
MARGO SHĔN: Why didn't you have it digitised?

73
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:51,450
TRAVIS TATE: Can't beat the feel of physical media on your fingers.

74
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,439
TRAVIS TATE: And in here, we ain't gonna be touching a whole lot else.

75
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,250
TRAVIS TATE: Figured I was gonna pass the time archivin' 'em.

76
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,139
TRAVIS TATE: What about you?

77
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,134
MARGO SHĔN: Me? Work I guess.

78
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:05,649
MARGO SHĔN: My task queue stretches out for, like, three years.

79
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,624
MARGO SHĔN: There's a lot of sharp edges to round off.

80
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:11,850
MARGO SHĔN: After that, I hadn't really thought about it.

81
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:16,156
TRAVIS TATE: Ohhh, you will. You're what, thirty?

82
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,289
TRAVIS TATE: Reckon you'll be the one turning the lights off at the end.

83
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,039
TRAVIS TATE: Food for thought, huh, vegan?

84
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,850
MARGO SHĔN: This sucks forever.

85
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,166
TRAVIS TATE: Nah, not forever. Just the rest of your life.

86
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,950
ALOY: Guess that's my way across.

87
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,090
ALOY: This should be the last power cell I need
to get to that ancient armour I found.

88
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,850
ALOY: It's, uh, held like this for nineteen years, right?

89
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,149
SYLENS: Well…

90
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,659
ALOY: Don't–don't answer.

91
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,450
ALOY: Oh, glad that's over.

92
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,226
ALOY: Not this way. Maybe further up the shaft.

93
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,200
ALOY: This must have been where they lived.

94
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,163
ALOY: What's left of it.

95
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:57,049
ALOY: Once this was all enclosed by rock and metal.

96
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,143
MARGO SHĔN: Record. I just woke up.

97
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:36,536
MARGO SHĔN: It's … I see the numbers, but can't make out the time.

98
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:41,608
MARGO SHĔN: I was dreaming of… I was giving a lecture in Q Hall.

99
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:46,496
MARGO SHĔN: Maybe it was something more shamanistic, I don't know.

100
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,339
MARGO SHĔN: An audience of shadowy faces under a blank, open sky.

101
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,509
MARGO SHĔN: I told them the world ended with a bang.

102
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,630
MARGO SHĔN: A plague of robots.

103
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,259
MARGO SHĔN: The last humans; we went out not with a whimper, but a whisper.

104
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,085
MARGO SHĔN: You know, in caves.

105
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:08,049
MARGO SHĔN: Ending like we started, huddled around a flickering glow.

106
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,791
MARGO SHĔN: Heads of state, the Fortune Fives,
the leaders, lottery winners, and life cults.

107
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,264
MARGO SHĔN: All of them buried in their little shelters.

108
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,300
MARGO SHĔN: Some believing they'll live it out, someway, somehow.

109
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,514
MARGO SHĔN: Or Elysium, or us here at Gaia Prime, no different.

110
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:31,049
MARGO SHĔN: A multitude of tiny societies taking hold, flaring, dying.

111
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,696
MARGO SHĔN: Some will be beautiful, some horrific.

112
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,849
MARGO SHĔN: And none of them matter.

113
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:43,167
MARGO SHĔN: Short term civilizations, one last gasp.

114
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,929
MARGO SHĔN: One last gasp before the long held breath.

115
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,049
MARGO SHĔN: Before I wake up, I know the audience is gone.

116
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:56,950
MARGO SHĔN: I'm talking to myself, to a quiet planet, a barren sphere.

117
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,130
MARGO SHĔN: Just Gaia and her long, long dreaming.

118
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,150
MARGO SHĔN: I hope she won't be lonely.

119
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,849
CHARLES RONSON: Evacuation happened so fast.

120
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,049
CHARLES RONSON: No time to think things through.

121
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,900
CHARLES RONSON: No time for goodbyes.

122
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,278
CHARLES RONSON: There were lines in the medical ward.

123
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,004
CHARLES RONSON: I told Tom Paech I'd be with him when he went under.

124
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:30,862
CHARLES RONSON: But there was one last shipment of
Paradisaeidae zygotes I could get processed if I rushed.

125
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,548
CHARLES RONSON: I'm still angry at him, forcing me to choose.

126
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:40,646
CHARLES RONSON: Angry at myself for, well…

127
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:46,759
CHARLES RONSON: He died alone,
and I didn't get the bloody birds of paradise saved either.

128
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,975
CHARLES RONSON: All the time left in the world now to think.

129
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,440
CHARLES RONSON: Gaia Prime's locks are sealed.

130
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,831
CHARLES RONSON: Elysium sealed up safe and sound.

131
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:03,034
CHARLES RONSON: A distance of miles,
but it might as well be on the other side of the galaxy.

132
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:07,529
CHARLES RONSON: All the Betas and Gammas
and support staff living their lives.

133
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,160
CHARLES RONSON: If I hadn't been an Alpha…

134
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,349
CHARLES RONSON: If things had gone differently…

135
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,950
CHARLES RONSON: …I could have been there.

136
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,109
CHARLES RONSON: Instead, I'm spending the rest of my unnatural life in here with people I don't even like.

137
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:29,200
CHARLES RONSON: And without the one
I would have gladly spent my life with, given the chance.

138
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,788
CHARLES RONSON: Two hours since I signed off on the final executables
and I'm already a bitter old man bitching to his Focus.

139
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:39,339
CHARLES RONSON: There's a thought for future generations.

140
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,945
ALOY: Elisabet's room, I know it.

141
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,619
ALOY: She didn't even get a chance to unpack.

142
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:33,991
ALOY: These are her journals, Elisabet's journals, and they're all destroyed?

143
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,644
SYLENS: Scan them. The Focus can rebuild them, but the process is slow.

144
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,338
SYLENS: To us it seems a powerful device, but it's engine is tiny and limited.

145
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,880
ALOY: How slow?

146
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,900
SYLENS: Days, weeks, years.

147
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,589
SYLENS: Concern yourself with stopping Hades and extending the future,
and you might live long enough to hear them.

148
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:04,440
ALOY: Elisabet.

149
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,279
ALOY: What is this?

150
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,670
CHARLES RONSON: This is Charles Ronson.

151
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:29,849
CHARLES RONSON: I'm logging this six hours
after final deployment of Gaia Prime.

152
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,000
CHARLES RONSON: This morning, an access port seal malfunctioned.

153
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,249
CHARLES RONSON: Gaia Prime's port seals were designed
to close with a seam of less than two millimetres.

154
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,589
CHARLES RONSON: But this one closed with a ten millimetre gap.

155
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,950
CHARLES RONSON: Enough for an energy signature to bleed through.

156
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:52,950
CHARLES RONSON: Enough for the swarm to detect this facility.

157
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,967
CHARLES RONSON: Enough for Gaia to be discovered and destroyed.

158
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:01,985
CHARLES RONSON: Enough to end the future
we worked so hard to make possible.

159
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:10,354
CHARLES RONSON: Unless the hatch servos
were manually re-engaged from the outside.

160
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,170
CHARLES RONSON: I'm now switching to a recording of the event.

161
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,446
TRAVIS TATE: Well, I'm not going out there. Not what I signed up for.

162
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:24,989
PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: Either we send someone out,
or all of this was for nothing.

163
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,818
CHARLES RONSON: It should be Lis's decision.

164
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,328
PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: So when is she going to get here?

165
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,365
SAMINA EBADJI: She said five minutes. You don't think…?

166
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,059
MARGO SHĔN: Oh no.

167
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,598
ELISABET SOBECK: Okay everyone, I've repaired the seal. Gaia?

168
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:44,945
GAIA: Seal closure at 1.4 millimetres, confirmed.

169
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,499
CHARLES RONSON: Elisabet, no! We'll find a way to bring you back in.

170
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,345
ELISABET SOBECK: Its not gonna happen, the swarm's too close.

171
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,056
ELISABET SOBECK: Really, it's alright.

172
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,217
ELISABET SOBECK: Gaia's complete.

173
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,015
ELISABET SOBECK: She'll take care of things
from here on out, that's what she does.

174
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,390
CHARLES RONSON: Not like this. There's so much we—

175
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,576
ELISABET SOBECK: Guys, you know, me, I'm…

176
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,928
ELISABET SOBECK: I'm not good at endings. At letting things end.

177
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:14,305
ELISABET SOBECK: So um, let's not.

178
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:22,909
TRAVIS TATE: So, happy trails, Liz, and see you around.

179
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:27,332
ELISABET SOBECK: Yeah, take care of each other, alright?

180
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,282
CHARLES RONSON: Lis…

181
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:32,127
ELISABET SOBECK: I'm okay with this. I wanna go home.

182
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,079
ELISABET SOBECK: Goodbye.

183
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:48,630
CHARLES RONSON: That was the last transmission of Elisabet Sobeck.

184
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,700
CHARLES RONSON: She gave everything for the hope of life on this planet.

185
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:57,670
CHARLES RONSON: And we are all in her debt.

186
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,460
Aloy?

187
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,049
She's gone.

188
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,190
Really gone.

189
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,259
You knew she couldn't have survived, Aloy.

190
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,193
And her achievements were … beyond exceptional.

191
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,604
While her people bickered she was the one who took responsibility.

192
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:30,180
The only one who could.

193
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,799
She was better than them.

194
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,630
That's not what I said.

195
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,405
She was, you shouldn't be afraid to admit it.

196
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:43,526
You think she was better because she was smart,
because she designed Zero Dawn, but you missed the point.

197
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:51,450
What made her great was that she was willing
to sacrifice herself for others, for everyone who would come later.

198
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,554
No, she couldn't let her creation fail.

199
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,661
Saying that shows you misunderstand her completely.

200
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:02,824
To her, everyone had value, everything was worth saving.

201
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,890
She gave her life in service to that idea.

202
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,225
Doesn't that stir anything in you, the generosity of it?

203
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:14,038
You're trying to invest her decision with something magical.

204
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,349
It was a rational choice, not based on sentimentality.

205
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,700
You're wrong.

206
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,779
Remember, she knew it wasn't enough for Gaia to think.

207
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:31,819
She taught Gaia to feel, to care, to sacrifice,
to believe in life, enough to fight against hopelessness.

208
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,949
If it wasn't for that sentimentality, life would have ended.

209
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,220
You and I would never have existed.

210
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,170
Your argument is sound.

211
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,616
I'm sorry for your … loss.

212
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,154
She said she wanted to go home.

213
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,744
Maybe…

214
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,000
What?

215
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,957
Nothing, it's time to go on.

216
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,203
TRAVIS TATE: Look Liz, you were a pretty stand up gal.

217
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,117
TRAVIS TATE: I'm sorry you died.

218
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:15,585
TRAVIS TATE: If you had a home to go to, I hope you got there first.

219
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,100
TRAVIS TATE: But this monument Ronson's made to you?

220
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,538
TRAVIS TATE: Kinda creepy, if you ask me.

221
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,269
TRAVIS TATE: Rest in peace, Liz.

222
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,160
TRAVIS TATE: God knows you earned it.

223
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,627
PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: Alright, let's start over from Eleuthia 1.

224
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,538
GAIA: Running integrity tests.

225
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,454
GAIA: Dr Brochard-Klein, may I speak outside protocol?

226
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:19,346
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: I suppose so, there's no-one to stop you.

227
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,660
GAIA: Doctor, you are fatigued.

228
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,730
GAIA: You have been logging abnormal sleep cycles.

229
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,049
GAIA: Are you suffering from depression?

230
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,589
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Well, I am trapped
in a science facility for the rest of my life.

231
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,538
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: How about you?

232
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:41,937
GAIA: In a time slice of a quadrillion operating cycles,
ten thousand are involved with processing the loss of Doctor Sobeck.

233
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:45,019
GAIA: I've considered quarantining these processes.

234
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,359
GAIA: Do you think that would be wise?

235
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,009
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: I'm not a psychologist Gaia, or an AI scientist.

236
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,272
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: No, it is natural.

237
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:05,059
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: At least in the context of the work
you and I have accomplished, which begs the meaning of the term natural.

238
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:14,544
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: She was your creator,
the patron saint of this crazy endeavour, "Our Lady of the Fervent Hypothetical".

239
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:22,252
GAIA: Even assuming a string of significant failure combinations,
Zero Dawn's chances of success are greater than the hypothetical.

240
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:26,446
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Hm. It's called a manner of speech, Gaia. Take a note.

241
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,160
CHARLES RONSON: You'd hate it, Liz, but I wrote you a eulogy.

242
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,238
CHARLES RONSON: I had to try to express…

243
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:44,881
CHARLES RONSON: Hm. All your … children…

244
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,245
CHARLES RONSON: After all Apollo has taught them,
they'll think they know everything.

245
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,710
CHARLES RONSON: But they have to understand what you did for them.

246
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,523
CHARLES RONSON: How you loved the whole world so much.

247
00:29:56,523 --> 00:30:03,834
CHARLES RONSON: With an intensity that was dazzling, bruising.

248
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,857
CHARLES RONSON: And in the end, it killed you.

249
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:11,184
CHARLES RONSON: Or you died for it, different perspectives.

250
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,180
CHARLES RONSON: No-one could keep up with you, live up to you.

251
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:21,216
CHARLES RONSON: I-I don't know.
Maybe if-if I hadn't taken that post-doc in Jo'burg…

252
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,287
CHARLES RONSON: I'm glad you shot down the Lightkeeper Protocol in the end.

253
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,849
CHARLES RONSON: I don't think I could've taken seeing another one of you.

254
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,039
CHARLES RONSON: I mean…

255
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,281
CHARLES RONSON: Elisabet Sobeck? There's only one.

256
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,849
CHARLES RONSON: I miss you.

257
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,164
CHARLES RONSON: Hello Margo, how are you holding up?

258
00:30:49,422 --> 00:30:56,416
MARGO SHĔN: Um, Dr Ronson, I've been getting
a lot of messages, unsolicited messages, from Ted.

259
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:00,170
CHARLES RONSON: Oh Margo, I'm sorry.

260
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:06,910
CHARLES RONSON: With Liz gone, we've got no-one to run interference with him.

261
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,019
CHARLES RONSON: I'll talk to Ted.

262
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,874
CHARLES RONSON: He mostly wants updates, constant updates.

263
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:16,699
CHARLES RONSON: Hundreds of updates on things he knows nothing about.

264
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,049
CHARLES RONSON: Liz used to field all of his crap.

265
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,479
MARGO SHĔN: He doesn't understand the systems at all.

266
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,950
MARGO SHĔN: That was kind of by design,
but he's getting pretty sketchy with me.

267
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,899
CHARLES RONSON: We just have to keep him happy.

268
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,538
CHARLES RONSON: Liz always said "keep him happy".

269
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,755
MARGO SHĔN: Are you kidding? Ever hear how she talked to him?

270
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,119
CHARLES RONSON: She was managing him, Margo.

271
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,189
MARGO SHĔN: I mean, maybe I should ignore him.

272
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,740
MARGO SHĔN: He's buried in his pyramid
with the holo-holo girls and Pantah Antimod cuckoos.

273
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,160
MARGO SHĔN: What can he do?

274
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:57,759
TED FARO: Hey Liz. I know…

275
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,646
TED FARO: I know you're never going to hear this.

276
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,160
TED FARO: That's not the point.

277
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,569
TED FARO: You, uh, huh.

278
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:09,828
TED FARO: You got to play the saviour and the martyr all at once this time.

279
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,328
TED FARO: Great work.

280
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,437
TED FARO: What are we gonna plug into their heads, Liz?

281
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:03,799
TED FARO: A whole lot of history?

282
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,197
TED FARO: A whole lot of so-called truth?

283
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,390
TED FARO: A wh-whole lot of noise?

284
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,826
TED FARO: It's not pablum, Liz. It's poison.

285
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,500
ALOY: There's another section at the back of the crater.

286
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,102
ALOY: Looks like it survived the blast.

287
00:34:09,102 --> 00:34:13,079
SYLENS: Because it was armoured. You've found the control room.

288
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,289
ALOY: I'm on my way.

289
00:35:03,422 --> 00:35:07,000
TED FARO: I've… I've been taking a hard look at the project.

290
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,634
TED FARO: In the end it's simple.

291
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:11,562
TED FARO: It's clean, it's clear.

292
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,849
TED FARO: Erasure.

293
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:17,175
TED FARO: Addition by subtraction.

294
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,139
TED FARO: I can make it better, Liz.

295
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:24,855
TED FARO: With a single stroke, make it all go away.

296
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,841
ALOY: I really don't like the direction this is going.

297
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,460
SYLENS: Continue.

298
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:10,000
ALOY: When I opened the hatch, the air rushed in from this side.

299
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,630
SYLENS: Because there was none inside the chamber.

300
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:15,369
ALOY: But the Alphas were in there.

301
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:01,909
CHARLES RONSON: I'm locked out of core control: "Alpha clearance overridden".

302
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:03,633
CHARLES RONSON: What the hell is Omega clearance?

303
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,032
SAMINA EBADJI: Oh no.

304
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:06,489
TED FARO: Alpha personnel.

305
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,946
TED FARO: Sorry to alarm you, but I need you to listen, okay?

306
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,039
TED FARO: To what I'm about to say.

307
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
TED FARO: This isn't easy.

308
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:25,567
TED FARO: See, uh, I've, uh, please stop trying to access the s-system, okay?

309
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,880
TED FARO: See–see, what this is about is, um…

310
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,949
TED FARO: I said stop trying to access the goddamn system.

311
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:41,619
TED FARO: W-What I'm trying to say is,
I can't stop thinking about the ones who'll come after us.

312
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,735
TED FARO: Those innocents, those blameless men…

313
00:37:45,735 --> 00:37:47,690
TED FARO: …and-and-and-and women.

314
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,546
TED FARO: We're gonna give them knowledge? Like it's a gift?

315
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:55,348
SAMINA EBADJI: Ted, Ted. We've talked about this before.

316
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,908
SAMINA EBADJI: Apollo has three-thousand-plus failsafe conditions.

317
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,960
TED FARO: It's not a gift, it's a disease.

318
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,458
TED FARO: They're the cure and we're gonna give them the disease.

319
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,243
TED FARO: Our disease? No. We can't.

320
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:12,036
TED FARO: And it's not too late if we're willing to sacrifice.

321
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,318
SAMINA EBADJI: Ted, it doesn't need to be like this.

322
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,750
TED FARO: It already is Samina.

323
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,611
TED FARO: I did three minutes ago.

324
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:21,426
TED FARO: I've purged Apollo, it's gone, all of it, every copy.

325
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:27,300
CHARLES RONSON: A "sacrifice"? It's not a sacrifice,
it's cultural obliteration you crazy bastard!

326
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,748
CHARLES RONSON: Millennia of culture…

327
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,918
TED FARO: I'm sorry, really I am.

328
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:39,576
TED FARO: But sometimes to protect innocents, innocents have to die.

329
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,513
COMPUTER: Emergency alert. Venting atmosphere.

330
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:13,760
He… he killed them all.

331
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,639
So this is why.

332
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,167
This is why we were trapped in benighted ignorance.

333
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,248
For an "innocent" future.

334
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:28,509
"Blameless men" — he never saw the slaughter in the Sun-Ring.

335
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,855
Everything these people achieved, all the knowledge of the Old Ones?

336
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:40,000
Evaporated, turned to dust, scattered to the void.

337
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,478
Like the Alphas themselves.

338
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:45,829
No, not a void.

339
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:54,234
When the hatch unsealed and scattered their ashes
on the wind, it took them out among the world they made.

340
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:55,969
The world we are living in.

341
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,304
It's–it's a monument to what they died trying to accomplish.

342
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,300
A monument to oblivion.

343
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,230
Not oblivion, Sylens, hope.

344
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,820
The master override.

345
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,509
It's so small.

346
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,426
SYLENS: Now all you have to do is kill Hades with it.

347
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,590
ALOY: Didn't sound good.

348
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,019
SYLENS: Try not to fall to your death.

349
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,519
SYLENS: The master override doesn't override gravity.

350
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:59,796
ALOY: Keep holding, keep holding!

351
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:50,867
ALOY: Oh, you're here.

352
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,098
For a moment.

353
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,219
What?

354
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,976
Our journey together has come to an end, Aloy.

355
00:42:56,694 --> 00:43:01,881
But before I go, I think I owe it to you to tell you the rest of the story.

356
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,590
Go on.

357
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,745
Some time ago I admitted that I've been … involved with the Eclipse.

358
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,010
But I never told you the full extent of my culpability.

359
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,429
The truth is, I was there at the beginning.

360
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:23,615
I found Hades, Aloy, buried on that mountain, trapped in that shattered Titan.

361
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,510
And I served it.

362
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:27,498
What?!

363
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,940
It promised knowledge and delivered.

364
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:35,135
Such knowledge, you have no idea.

365
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,950
And in exchange?

366
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,869
I helped create the Eclipse.

367
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,815
Helped it build a cult, an army to do its will.

368
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:46,798
Why are you telling me this now?

369
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,730
Because your success depends on knowing this.

370
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:55,502
When I found Hades, the first thing it wanted to know about was the Spire.

371
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:58,510
Not Meridian, the Spire.

372
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:01,099
Now why would that be?

373
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,530
The Spire was created by Gaia.

374
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,099
Which part of Gaia?

375
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,284
Minerva, its code breaking module.

376
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:17,651
Gaia built spires to transmit the codes that deactivated the Faro robots.

377
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:20,769
Shut down their biomatter conversion systems.

378
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:23,636
Hades wants to send a new transmission!

379
00:44:23,636 --> 00:44:27,909
To wake the machines so they can devour the world all over again!

380
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:33,409
Yes, based on what we've learned, that's my conclusion as well.

381
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:39,719
So the Eclipse, the robots they've resurrected, they're just a means to an end.

382
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,788
An army to capture the Spire!

383
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:49,475
Yes, so Hades can exterminate life all over again unless you stop it.

384
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:54,812
I want you to tell me everything, Hades, the Eclipse, everything.

385
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:56,929
It's a long story, Aloy.

386
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,988
Then get started.

387
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,020
It began with a Focus.

388
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,866
Recovered from an ancient ruin, as yours was so many years ago.

389
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,099
In my case, the device was heavily damaged.

390
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,639
There was just a flicker of life in it.

391
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:19,217
I spent weeks studying it, attempting repairs until finally I succeeded.

392
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:25,710
A whole new dimension of perception revealed right before my eyes.

393
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:30,515
That's when I detected it, a faint signal.

394
00:45:30,954 --> 00:45:35,219
Out there something was searching just like I was.

395
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,019
A real kindred spirit.

396
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:40,639
I followed the signal to its source.

397
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,210
A shattered Titan buried in the jungles of the Jewel.

398
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,059
So you thought it was a Titan, an old war machine?

399
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,000
I didn't know what to think.

400
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,099
I'd seen such wreckage before. The Grave-Hoard, for example.

401
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,054
But this was different, this was not quite dead.

402
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:07,400
It couldn't speak when I found it, until my repairs gave it a voice.

403
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:11,489
So began an exchange of knowledge.

404
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:16,694
It wanted to know everything about our world, its tribes and machines.

405
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,309
But the Spire was always its foremost concern.

406
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,090
What did it want to know about the Spire?

407
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:31,070
Its precise location, the surrounding geography, who controlled land.

408
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:37,219
Meanwhile, Hades revealed to me many of the intricacies of ancient technology.

409
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:40,889
It bid me to recover and repair more Focuses.

410
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,300
Before long, I had a couple of dozen up and running.

411
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,519
Enough to equip a small army.

412
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,606
The commanders of one anyway.

413
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,590
I didn't care.

414
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:58,041
I was learning so much, physics, calculus, you have no idea.

415
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,989
And the Shadow Carja? How did they become involved?

416
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:05,078
The Carja civil war was a happy coincidence.

417
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,699
A perfect opportunity.

418
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:10,834
An opportunity?! That's what it was to you?

419
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:11,989
Yes.

420
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,559
Overnight, half the tribe was in exile, desperate to win back Holy Meridian.

421
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,139
Their religion made them easy to manipulate.

422
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:26,112
All I had to do was present Hades as the Buried Shadow of their mythology.

423
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:29,349
So, yes, it was an opportunity.

424
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,052
I arranged for High Priest Bahavas to meet with Hades.

425
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:34,789
Helis was there as well.

426
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:37,590
And so the Eclipse was born.

427
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,590
Anything to win back Holy Meridian.

428
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,057
But Hades didn't care about Meridian, and neither did you.

429
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,590
We live in a world of fallen cities and vanished tribes.

430
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,599
What were a few more?

431
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:59,699
Besides, I was too busy setting up
the cult's Focus network to Hades' specifications.

432
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,914
A thrilling technical challenge.

433
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:06,989
Especially with the alterations I included of my own design.

434
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,780
The ability for you to spy on them.

435
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,258
Yes.

436
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:17,079
I may have been foolish enough to serve Hades,
but I was never so foolish that I trusted it.

437
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:22,407
I installed what the ancients used to call a "backdoor" in the network.

438
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:27,448
Secret access, empowering me to monitor all activity and communications.

439
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:31,500
What made you turn on Hades? Certainly wasn't your conscience.

440
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:38,720
Actually, I was troubled the first time
I saw the Eclipse raise an ancient war robot with my technology.

441
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:42,389
I questioned Hades about its intentions.

442
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,834
A little late.

443
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:44,920
Indeed.

444
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,980
I'd already outlived my usefulness.

445
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:53,829
When I completed work on the Focus network,
Hades summoned me to receive my reward.

446
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:58,019
The next moment I heard it broadcast my kill order.

447
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,780
I've been a fugitive ever since.

448
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,634
So when did I come into this? Our path together?

449
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:06,579
When Olin stumbled on you.

450
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:09,570
"System threat detected."

451
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,150
That got my attention.

452
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:16,280
A kill order against a savage Nora girl?

453
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:19,230
Why would Hades bother with that?

454
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:23,405
But then I saw that this Nora girl was wearing a Focus.

455
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:27,719
And bore an uncanny resemblance to a great scientist of the Old World.

456
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,190
Helis moved quickly.

457
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,389
I thought you were dead.

458
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,010
But then I detected your Focus inside the Nora mountain.

459
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:44,806
The more I observed you, the more convinced 
I became of your extraordinary nature, and usefulness.

460
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:50,349
Through you I could finally discover the secrets of the earth.

461
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,150
I vowed to do everything I could to ensure your success.

462
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:01,669
You've done terrible things, Sylens,
but you've also done what you could to undo them.

463
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,134
I can't say you've balanced the scale, but at least you've tried.

464
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:13,570
To be clear, Aloy, I would do it all again.

465
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,559
A few more safeguards, perhaps, but basically the same.

466
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,599
Take my lance.

467
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,579
Fit the master override to it and you have a means of injection.

468
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:28,667
Then I just need to get close enough to Hades' skull to stab it in?

469
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:29,980
Exactly.

470
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:31,570
Oh, no problem.

471
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:34,829
Sylens!

472
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,679
Where will you go?

473
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:43,976
Elsewhere and everywhere.

474
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,267
There's so much more to discover before the world ends.

475
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:51,922
ALOY: And all this?

476
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:54,134
SYLENS: I leave it to you, of course.

477
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,500
SYLENS: As it turned out, it was yours all along.

478
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,605
I was merely tresspassing.

479
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:18,610
SYLENS: I travelled far to find you.

480
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,670
SYLENS: I heard your transmission.

481
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,948
SYLENS: It was you, wasn't it?

482
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,440
HADES: Entity is not known.

483
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,000
SYLENS: I'm called Sylens. And you are?

484
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:34,395
SYLENS: I don't think you'd have called out if there wasn't something you wanted.

485
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,835
SYLENS: You called, I responded.

486
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:40,000
SYLENS: Will you tell me your name?

487
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,627
HADES: Hades.

488
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:43,989
SYLENS: You are a creation of the ancients.

489
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,700
SYLENS: A war machine?

490
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,188
HADES: Define timeline.

491
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:55,550
SYLENS: Time? Ah. It is the thirteenth king of the Carja Sundom's reign.

492
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,849
HADES: Define Carja.

493
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:59,619
SYLENS: We're getting ahead of ourselves.

494
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,838
SYLENS: Were you created by the ancients?

495
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,260
SYLENS: I wonder how long you waited here buried until I chanced upon you.

496
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:10,354
SYLENS: How long you have to wait for another.

497
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,489
SYLENS: You're obviously very powerful.

498
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,650
SYLENS: But you're not going to get anywhere without me.

499
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:21,260
HADES: Titan frame merely houses intellect. Define Carja.

500
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,170
SYLENS: Now that's more like it.

501
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:34,559
SYLENS: They're coming.

502
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,409
HADES: Preparations are complete.

503
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:41,416
SYLENS: Ah, Lucent Bahavas, behold!

504
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:44,048
SYLENS: As I promised you.

505
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:50,000
BAHAVAS: What manner of great machine is this? I've never seen such a thing.

506
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:58,464
BAHAVAS: Stay—stay your ground, Carja-in-Shadow.

507
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:03,173
HADES: Incorrect. Bow before the Buried Shadow.

508
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,855
BAHAVAS: "The Buried Shadow"? I–I don't understand.

509
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:12,573
HADES: Did Araman understand the Glinthawk that perched upon the Alight?

510
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,908
BAHAVAS: It speaks scripture!

511
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:20,312
HADES: Araman followed the shadow cast from the Spire.

512
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:23,420
BAHAVAS: To the mesa where Holy Meridian was founded.

513
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:27,238
HADES: You will follow the shadow once more.

514
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,050
BAHAVAS: I am a righteous man, Chosen of the Sun.

515
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,738
BAHAVAS: But in times of need the powers of shadow
can accomplish what the Sun alone cannot.

516
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:42,924
BAHAVAS: Will… will you return to us what is ours, O Shadow of prophecy?

517
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:48,984
HADES: An army is required. Obey and Meridian is yours.

518
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:51,629
BAHAVAS: Of our obedience you can be certain.

519
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:01,338
HADES: Task is complete?

520
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,440
SYLENS: Yes.

521
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,750
SYLENS: The Focus network is active, built to your specifications.

522
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:10,387
SYLENS: Check it yourself if you must, I'll wait.

523
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:14,546
SYLENS: But I remind you of the reward you've been withholding.

524
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,330
SYLENS: Quantum processing?

525
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:22,253
HADES: Data has been compiled, volume too great for transfer.

526
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:26,849
SYLENS: How … inconvenient for me.

527
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,550
HADES: Come before me, you shall receive your reward.

528
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,181
SYLENS: Very well.

529
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:38,199
HADES: Helis, threat detected inside Eclipse.

530
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,281
HELIS: Speak its name, O Shadow, and it will die.

531
00:55:42,281 --> 00:55:45,905
HADES: You will eliminate this one: Sylens.

532
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:47,699
HELIS: Sylens.

533
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:49,980
HELIS: Yes!

534
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,005
HELIS: A truth whispered at night is seen in the day.

535
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:56,900
HELIS: He was never one of us.

536
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:58,630
HELIS: It will be done.

537
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:09,063
ALOY: I have to tell Avad that the Eclipse are ready to strike.

538
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:12,880
ALOY: After what happened with Dervahl I know he'll defend the city…

539
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,900
ALOY: …but the Spire?
