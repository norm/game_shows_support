1
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,300
I've done what I can to cleanse this valley of corruption.

2
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,200
Time to see if the Carja fort will let me pass over the mountains.

3
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,900
Sounds of fighting.

4
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,919
Has something attacked the Carja fort?

5
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,189
A Corruptor!

6
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,420
I'll find a use for you.

7
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,610
[Carja guard]
Truly the Sun shines upon us this day!

8
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,720
It wasn't the Sun risking its ass down here.

9
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,199
[Carja guard]
Girl! Approach.

10
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,569
So will you open the gate for me now?

11
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:59,778
[laughs] You heard her.

12
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,979
Open the gates! And send word to Captain Balahn.

13
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,509
[Carja guard]
Where you headed, girl?

14
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,920
West to Meridian.

15
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,489
The Way of Broken Stones is a hard run, even in the best of times.

16
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,789
You might wanna have a word with Captain Balahn.

17
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,269
He came from Meridian not long ago.

18
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,420
You'll find him in the fort on a balcony to the left, overlooking the valley.

19
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,199
Okay. Thanks.

20
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,212
We're the ones who should be thanking you for taking down those machines. 

21
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,600
Walk in light, Nora.

22
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:45,106
[Carja guard]
Always stay alert, that's what I say.

23
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,509
[Carja guard]
We all have our place in the order.

24
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,430
[Oseram trader]
Nothing but trouble, that's all there is in Banuk lands.

25
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:06,000
[Carja guard]
Don't ask me where to go if you're lost. I'm a guard, not the Town Crier.

26
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,799
Captain Balahn.

27
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,809
I have questions for you.

28
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,610
First about another Nora woman who might have come through here,

29
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,149
and second about the trail to Meridian.

30
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,009
What can I expect on the way?

31
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,058
Well, there was definitely another Nora.

32
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,580
No way I'd forget that.

33
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,149
She caused an incident.

34
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
As for what to expect on the trail?

35
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,120
Nothing good.

36
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,100
More machines all the time and our scouts report corruption that way as well.

37
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,000
So much for sealing things off.

38
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,329
Keep to the roads, they're safe enough.

39
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,320
Though after what you did at the gate, I'll wager you don't scare easy.

40
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,210
It's a good quality.

41
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,129
I could put it to use if you don't mind a quick jaunt back east.

42
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,469
I know it's bold of me to ask a favour after you just did one.

43
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,639
But I can offer you answers in return,

44
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,339
if there's anything you need to know about the Sundom.

45
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,230
What do you need, Captain?

46
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,210
I sent several patrols east when we got word of corrupted machines there.

47
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,459
All of them confirmed my fears.

48
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,899
So I sealed the gates.

49
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,110
But it looks like we left some men behind when they were closed.

50
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,200
Walid, tell her what happened.

51
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,610
Machines attacked us near an abandoned Nora village, sir.

52
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,019
Lakir told us to pull back.

53
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,350
Then I lost sight of the others.

54
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,600
Never seen a Nora woman before, soldier?

55
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,829
Have some respect.

56
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,308
Report to her, not to me.

57
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,489
Lakir always stresses reporting back.

58
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,850
So that's what I did.

59
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,379
I felt terrible about leaving them behind.

60
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,200
Now that the gates are open again, I can send someone after them.

61
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,019
Can't you send more soldiers to find the missing men?

62
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,259
What about Walid here?

63
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,678
Most Nora still don't take well to the sight of Carja armour.

64
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,009
Officially, it's a risk to send patrols so close to your Sacred Land.

65
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,710
I'd prefer not to do that again.

66
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,019
But heading that way won't be a problem for you.

67
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,149
[mutters] Please say yes.

68
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,620
What was that, soldier?

69
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,110
Nothing, sir.

70
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,360
I'll see what I can do about your missing men.

71
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:38,019
I would be grateful, but not as grateful as Walid.

72
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,139
You hear that, lunkhead?

73
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,634
You might be off the hook!

74
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:55,589
[Oseram trader]
Raised machines, with their shamans, damn nonsense. It's worse.

75
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,323
[whistle]

76
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,857
[whistle]

77
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,789
Black smoke, red tatters.

78
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,110
More bandits like the ones at Devil's Thirst.

79
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,809
So much for being careful.

80
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,611
[whistle]

81
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,710
They know I'm here now.

82
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,809
[Nora Brave]
A little help over here, please!

83
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,299
[Nora Brave]
You have my thanks and the thanks of my family.

84
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,710
[Nora Brave]
You saved my life.

85
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,029
[Nora Brave]
I promise I won't waste it.

86
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,509
The machines must have come across Captain Balahn's patrol here.

87
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,220
One of the Carja soldiers fell here.

88
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,309
The other soldiers must have retreated.

89
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,549
But to where?

90
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:38,009
This Carja fell far from the first battle.

91
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,430
At least his death came quickly.

92
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,930
Sun's making a show of it.

93
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,200
This can't be the helmet from the last Carja soldier.

94
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,119
Someone nearly lost his head here, then ran off.

95
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,299
Blood everywhere.

96
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,599
A machine dragged something into the water here.

97
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:03,599
But maybe he made it to that island.

98
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,210
Blood everywhere.

99
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,175
[in the distance]
By the Sun, by the Sun!

100
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:18,610
[in the distance]
I'm never really done!

101
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,379
[in the distance]
I brought down all the beasts

102
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:22,035
What is that, singing?

103
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:23,924
[in the distance]
But I missed out on the feasts!

104
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:27,625
[in the distance]
I went to the beer fount too many times to count.

105
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:32,874
[in the distance]
I fingered every curl but I never won the girl.

106
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:36,326
By the Sun, by the Sun!

107
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,752
I'm never really done!

108
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,046
I wasn't expecting to be found, especially not by a Nora.

109
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:52,374
I wasn't expecting to find a half clad Carjan soldier singing like a drunk.

110
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:55,819
I apologize for my behavior.

111
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,109
I thought I was dead.

112
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,420
Come on.

113
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,729
Your commander asked me to bring you back to Daytower.

114
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,710
I refuse to be led back to my outpost by a Nora, like some prisoner.

115
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,299
Humph, fine!

116
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,710
Go by yourself.

117
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,630
Wait.

118
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,109
Look, I got in a tussle with a Snapmaw.

119
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,929
It ate the half of me that was armour and bow.

120
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,410
The thief is still in the water.

121
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,099
I can't go back without a weapon.

122
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,170
Find my bow, please.

123
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,538
I'll get it, just don't start singing again.

124
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,519
Better watch out for that machine.

125
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,279
It doesn't look friendly.

126
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,920
Got their attention!

127
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,220
That hurt it!

128
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,920
They're angry!

129
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,849
Might regret this.

130
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,309
Here's your bow.

131
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,789
Good luck out there.

132
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,858
Thank you.

133
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,259
I, uh, I didn't want to die in foreign lands like my men.

134
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,609
May the Sun light their passing.

135
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,910
Got one.

136
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,809
Here we go again.

137
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,510
Back to your business.

138
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:07,973
[Oseram merchant]
Nothing but trouble, that's all there is in Banuk lands.

139
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,320
[Carja artisan]
I'll take a Carja merchant over an Oseram any day.

140
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,848
[Carja artisan]
Genuine craftsmanship.

141
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,710
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here!

142
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:21,749
[Carja merchant]
Won't cost you a shard just to look!

143
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,718
Lakir came back on his own.

144
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,500
A little worse for wear.
He seemed a bit embarrassed when I mentioned you.

145
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,929
Dare I ask?

146
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:32,429
He has a lovely singing voice.

147
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,598
That's a capital lie if I've ever heard one.

148
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,730
I'll have a talk with him about it.

149
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,719
What is this place exactly?

150
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,628
Daytower marks the eastern edge of Carja territory.

151
00:35:41,628 --> 00:35:46,929
A trading post, a waystation, one with an ugly reputation among your people.

152
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:50,868
During the reign of the last Sun-King, many Nora were taken captive.

153
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:54,920
Then gathered here for transport to Meridian and sacrifice.

154
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,119
But the Sun set on that.

155
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,920
I was appointed by the Sun-King Avad to make sure
all Carja at this outpost show respect to the Nora.

156
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,559
Did an Oseram named Olin come through here?

157
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,807
Twice.

158
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:09,009
He was part of the royal delegation to the Nora.

159
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:11,090
And they passed through on the way, then back.

160
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,590
They brought back stories of a vicious attack on your people.

161
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:16,460
My condolences, of course.

162
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,530
Sun-King Avad wants peace.

163
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:20,699
So do the Matriarchs, I'm told.

164
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,090
But old wounds are slow to mend, and both tribes are proud.

165
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:28,296
My task is to make sure there are no further provocations from the Sundom,

166
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:31,179
especially now after, well…

167
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:34,935
While your people recover from this terrible attack I mean.

168
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,909
Do you know where Olin is now?

169
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,230
Not exactly.

170
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,558
But he was on his way to Meridian.

171
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm certain of that.

172
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,460
Everyone goes to Meridian.

173
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,340
It's a changed place, a living city.

174
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,090
Nothing like it was during the rule of Sun-King Jiran.

175
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,260
Avad,  our new king, has done all he can to make sure of that.

176
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,817
Slavery has been abolished.

177
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,405
There's a new alliance with the Oseram.

178
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:57,218
And the Sun Ring, where so many outlanders were killed,

179
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,504
is now a memorial to the fallen.

180
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:02,530
Mad Sun-King Jiran raided the Oseram for years.

181
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,400
Avad managed to get them on his side.

182
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,448
He had help, of course.

183
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:08,188
Ersa and Erend played a part.

184
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,400
Oseram siblings, bigger than life.

185
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,500
They gathered an army to free Meridian.

186
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,058
I marched with them, scaled the north cliff with my men,
 and secured the Temple of the Sun.

187
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:19,610
Sent Jiran's kestrels and priests packing.

188
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,543
Now Oseram are a common sight in the city.

189
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:25,420
And a common sound too, they sure bicker a lot.

190
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,420
It sounds as though you approve of the new Sun-King.

191
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,966
He is the chosen of the Sun,
and what the Sundom needs after ten years of war.

192
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:35,510
A calming light, not a scouring one.

193
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:38,370
Sun-King Jiran would shed blood at any slight.

194
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,789
For Sun-King Avad that's a last resort.

195
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,409
Lucky for those who slight him.

196
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,230
Some whisper in the shadows that he's weak.

197
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,199
No, peace is strength as the Sun shall show.

198
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,320
Is there anything more you can tell me about the road to Meridian?

199
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,289
Sun-King Avad has devoted considerable resources to making it safe.

200
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,083
But by the Sun's witness,
it's been harder to control in peace than it was during the war.

201
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,458
Machines grow more dangerous all the time.

202
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,733
Add to that bandits, and new reports of this corruption.

203
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:09,400
We're stretched thin to protect a few outposts like this one.

204
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,250
As for everywhere else.

205
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,090
Well, travel at your own risk.

206
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,610
You said something happened with Nakoa?

207
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,849
The Nora girl?

208
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,298
Yes, something happened.

209
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,579
Attempted murder.

210
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,848
Prefect Zaid can tell you more about it.

211
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,280
You can find him near the main tower, up the steps.

212
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,710
Wait.

213
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,467
Zaid is here?

214
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,300
He is.

215
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,300
Look, I've heard what your people say about him,
but he swears it's a case of mistaken identity.

216
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,971
If there's a shadow to him, I've never been able to prove it.

217
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:40,099
And the forbearance he showed towards this Nakoa woman was impressive.

218
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,699
Go, speak to him.

219
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,449
Maybe he knows where she went, and try not to assault him please.

220
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,114
[Carja]
Is that really all you have? Won't do at all.

221
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,099
[Oseram trader]
Those Shadow Carja scum are gonna pay for what they did to Ersa.

222
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,482
[Carja guard]
I heard that Oseram merchants charge us double…

223
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:25,510
[Carja guard]
or even triple of what they charge their own tribe.

224
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,920
[Carja outlander]
Hmm, hope I don't catch a chill.

225
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,389
[Carja outlander]
A spring in your step today.

226
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,539
[Carja outlander]
The Nora have always been suspicious of outsiders.

227
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,590
[Carja outlander]
I suppose they had good reason.

228
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,590
[Carja artisan]
It's all those savages I don't like.

229
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,199
[Carja artisan]
The longer this split with the Shadow Carja lasts, the more prices will go up.

230
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,590
[Carja artisan]
I utterly refuse to buy from an Oseram.

231
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,400
[Carja artisan]
They'll cheat you soon as look at you.

232
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,489
[Carja guard]
The Hunters Lodge should never have admitted those women or savages.

233
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,170
[Carja guard]
It's a noble Carja institution.

234
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,889
[Carja artisan]
Corruption spreads. More Sunless days are coming.

235
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,834
[Carja guard]
Watch out for the Oseram merchants.

236
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,690
[Carja guard]
They'll soon cheat you as look at you.

237
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:58,553
[Carja guard]
So there are Oseram in the Sundom now.

238
00:42:58,553 --> 00:42:59,989
[Carja guard]
I get up, I work.

239
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:01,179
[Carja guard]
Same as always.

240
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,450
You're Zaid.

241
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,190
And you're a Nora.

242
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,678
I can tell from your tone you've heard of me.

243
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,849
Let me ease your mind.

244
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:13,079
There seemed to be wild stories about me among your tribe.

245
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,670
But the Nora have me mistaken for someone else.

246
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,420
I'm not sure where the fault lies, but the fog of war often breeds confusion.

247
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,509
Unfortunately, some refused to acknowledge the error.

248
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,690
So it was with the last Nora who came through here.

249
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:31,280
You mean Nakoa?

250
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,769
Is that her name?

251
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,730
Ah well, it was a very unfortunate situation.

252
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,190
She attacked me in broad daylight.

253
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,570
If one of my men hadn't spotted her, I might well have been injured.

254
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,480
But we were able to subdue her without harm.

255
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,070
What did you do with her?

256
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,000
I let her go of course.

257
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,170
It was clear she thought I was responsible for unspeakable things.

258
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,239
So in a sense, her actions were justifiable.

259
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,250
But all this nonsense about torture and murder? That wasn't me.

260
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,670
They have me confused with some other commander.

261
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:08,355
I don't doubt some of my comrades did bad things,

262
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:12,690
but Sun-King Avad has worked hard to eliminate such brutality.

263
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,469
Where is Nakoa now?

264
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,239
I don't know exactly.

265
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:19,869
She left raving that she would find a way to bring me down.

266
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,294
But I did hear a report from the garrison at Lonesome Rock

267
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:26,036
That a young woman had been abducted by bandits.

268
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:27,190
Might have been her.

269
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,179
You've really gone out of your way to help, Prefect Zaid.

270
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,118
It's no trouble.

271
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,469
The Sun-King wishes to make amends with your people
and I am his humble servant.

272
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:40,409
I'll go to Lonesome Rock and get to the bottom of this.

273
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,278
I promise you that.

274
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:43,498
You do that.

275
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:48,269
And if our men are anything less than helpful, please let me know.

276
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:34,859
Can't trust him, not after what Yan told me.

277
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,500
That garrison is my only lead.

278
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:45,558
[Carja guard]
Always stay bright, always stay alert. That's what I say.

279
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:52,738
[Carja guard]
We have to trust in our king…

280
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,480
[Carja merchant]
Would you like to buy something today?

281
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,493
[Carja guard]
Machines or bandits try to get past me?

282
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,809
[Carja guard]
They'll have a fight. Mark my words.

283
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:19,656
[Carja artisan]
I face the Sun's pride because I know I earned my place.

284
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:21,250
[Carja merchant]
Take a look at these wares!

285
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,809
[Aloy]
Snow chill, itches.

286
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,760
[Carja outlander]
I hope you and your family are well.

287
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:38,022
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods!

288
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,300
[Carja merchant]
Check out these wares.

289
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,528
[Carja merchant]
Only the finest goods here, see for yourself!

290
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:33,460
The world beyond the Sacred Land.

291
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,740
I need to find Olin and learn everything he knows.

292
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,980
Who the killers were, how they saw me through his Focus.

293
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:44,550
Who the woman is, the one who looks like me.

294
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:46,829
Why they want me dead.

295
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:49,079
Olin's trail leads to Meridian.

296
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,539
When I catch him, he will talk.

297
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,880
And he will pay for all the lives he's ruined.
