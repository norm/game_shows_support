1
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,329
Maker's End, not much farther now.

2
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,791
Olin said he found an image of the woman I resemble on an ancient device.

3
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:36,561
If she's my mother, why would there be traces of her
all the way out here, so far from Nora land?

4
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,076
I don't get it. Who is she?

5
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:42,579
[voice from Focus]
Her name is Elisabet Sobeck.

6
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,549
[Aloy]
You! Spying through my Focus again?

7
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,003
[Aloy]
Well, go on, what do you know about her?

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,094
[voice from Focus]
Stay on your present course and before long

9
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:58,483
[voice from Focus]
you'll know her as well as I do. Maybe better.

10
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,100
[voice from Focus]
But be wary.

11
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,353
[voice from Focus]
Maker's End is crawling with Eclipse troops.

12
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:08,000
[voice from Focus]
To help you deal with them, I've left some useful equipment just outside the ruins.

13
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,930
Hardy little plant, you'll help.

14
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,350
Nutritious.

15
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,450
How much will this snow cover?

16
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,067
Move along now.

17
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,950
Can breathe again.

18
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,239
[Cultist]
Got to get the demons raised.

19
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,803
Might be able to take them out one by one, if I stay out of sight.

20
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:30,615
[Cultist]
Who did this?

21
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,140
Don't mind me.

22
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,231
[Cultist]
Whoa…!

23
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,570
Right where he said it would be.

24
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,970
Not a bad selection.

25
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,759
I'll put those to use.

26
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,409
Why are you doing this?

27
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,350
[voice from Focus]
Because I want you to succeed.

28
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,030
[voice from Focus]
Good hunting, we'll talk later.

29
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:48,342
Wait!

30
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,761
Pff, damn him.

31
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,302
It's heavy, world's going white.

32
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,190
Okay, you're okay.

33
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,950
Might regret this.

34
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,302
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Apocashitstorm Tour, day one.

35
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,660
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Where better to start than at the end?

36
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,038
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Or where the end started anyway.

37
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,549
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Ground zero.

38
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,049
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Where it all came crashing down.

39
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,289
[Voice from Vantage cache]
My career first.

40
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,380
[Voice from Vantage cache]
Then everything else.

41
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,759
[Voice from Vantage cache]
And I mean everything.

42
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:20,740
No room.

43
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,670
Corrupted Watchers, acting as guards.

44
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,462
The Eclipse and corrupted machines, co-operating.

45
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:03,450
One happy family.

46
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:50,961
[Cultist]
Got a body over here.

47
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:23,048
[Cultist]
The Shadow gives you strength, use it!

48
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,660
I'd have to ditch something.

49
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,750
These dig sites, they're massive.

50
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,095
Snow chill, itches.

51
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,140
Should've brought a cart.

52
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,321
All these ruins. What did the Old Ones do here?

53
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,640
Okay, no more sneaking.

54
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,170
Quietly.

55
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,233
[Cultist]
… take a look at that guard.

56
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:23,602
Corruptor. Might prove a challenge.

57
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,829
Got too much already.

58
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,239
Full already.

59
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,989
What have they been uncovering here?

60
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,940
I can't spare the weight.

61
00:38:54,909 --> 00:39:00,329
Snow haze, white as bone. Huh, that thought got dark.

62
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,678
An explosion?

63
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,340
Another explosion.

64
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,088
[in the distance]
All weapons operational.

65
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:04,531
[in the distance]
Time to get it moving, and be quick about it.

66
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:06,076
[in the distance]
No daydreaming.

67
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,109
Rotate turret!

68
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:23,667
Aaaaand fire!

69
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,519
Has to be one of the Deathbringers Olin talked about.

70
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,170
Fitting name.

71
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,000
[Cultist officer]
My Focus, it's stopped working.

72
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,409
[Voice from Focus]
I've disabled his Focus. The rest is up to you.

73
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,590
[Aloy]
I'll handle it.

74
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:03,834
I'll never get into that tower, unless I destroy that thing first.

75
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:23,415
Steam's blasting out. I wonder if those are weak points?

76
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,551
[Cultist]
What's that in the tall grass?

77
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:27,325
Gotcha!

78
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:43,987
[Cultist]
Bleed for the Shadow!

79
00:45:58,677 --> 00:46:01,079
Ha! Hitting that thing really hurt it!

80
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,590
Got too much already.

81
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:15,809
No room.

82
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,780
Let's see what you have to say.

83
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:08,000
What … what is this?

84
00:49:08,556 --> 00:49:11,125
[Metallic voice from Focus]
THE ENTITY LIVES?

85
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:16,444
[Metallic voice from Focus]
UNACCEPTABLE! UNACCEPTABLE! UNACCEPTABLE!

86
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,489
What the hell was that?

87
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:30,960
Hades?

88
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,309
Hey, mysterious stranger.

89
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:35,780
Did you see that?

90
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:39,242
No answer, huh? Figures.

91
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,308
Things just keep getting stranger.

92
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:44,579
I need to find a way inside the tower.

93
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:01,590
Looks tight, but I can squeeze through.

94
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,639
[Computer]
Hold for Identiscan.

95
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:20,449
Huh, one of these again.

96
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:27,712
pffff

97
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:40,462
[Computer]
Genetic profile confirmed. Entry authorised.

98
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:45,021
[Computer]
Greetings Dr Sobeck. Please step inside.
