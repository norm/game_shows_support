1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,219
SYLENS: The moment they see you, Hades will too.

2
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:28,353
SYLENS: He'll issue another kill order, and this time
the entire Shadow Carja military will be after you.

3
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:32,189
So disable their Focuses, you've done it before.

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,770
SYLENS: It's not that simple.

5
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,419
SYLENS: Too many Focuses in one place, each of them
communicating with each other and back to Hades.

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,134
A whole network of them.

7
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:42,288
"Network" — what's that?

8
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:48,299
Er, imagine a vast, invisible web stretched across the land
from end to end, connecting Focuses together.

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,083
Allowing them to communicate over vast distances instantaneously.

10
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:57,049
Alright, so is there some way to cut the web down?

11
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,969
Hmm. Crash the network? Audacious!

12
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,389
Yes, there is a way, a weak point in the network.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,834
Point the way.

14
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:11,849
I'll send the location data to your Focus.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,769
Head there, and I'll be in touch when you're close with more directions.

16
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,030
Keep things quiet.

17
00:05:56,368 --> 00:06:00,542
CARJA: It's not what I imagined when I was a boy, but it's decent work…

18
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,440
You're not—

19
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:04,980
Here they come.

20
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:15,388
SHADOW CARJA: Only the Carja in Shadow truly deserve the name Carja.

21
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:09,870
Hello!

22
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,649
These are something special.

23
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,998
Steady now, give me a second.

24
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,018
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: Aloy, you're very close now.

25
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,049
ALOY: I was wondering when you would speak up.

26
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,813
SYLENS: There's a sheer rock wall just ahead.

27
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:51,924
SYLENS: Look close and you'll find handholds leading up.

28
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:54,848
ALOY: Oh really? And who put those there, hmm?

29
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,539
ALOY: Right, why would I expect an answer?

30
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,082
ALOY: It's so much more exciting to keep it all a mystery.

31
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,680
ALOY: "Crash the Eclipse Focus network", he said.

32
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,880
ALOY: So how are we gonna do that?

33
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,319
ALOY: Oh wait, I forgot. "We" won't, I do all the dangerous stuff.

34
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,335
ALOY: You just listen in.

35
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,604
ALOY: Alright, what now?

36
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,450
SYLENS: We wait, that's what.

37
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,250
SYLENS: Take a seat at the campfire and rest.

38
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,549
SYLENS: When night falls we'll talk.

39
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,950
ALOY: At least I'll have a fire to keep me company.

40
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,390
ALOY: I wonder where the path through that crevice leads.

41
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,839
How nice of you to finally drop by.

42
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,108
Our purpose this night is to crash the Focus network.

43
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,667
Yeah, tell me the part I don't know. How?

44
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:03,692
For starters, you'll need to infiltrate the Eclipse's main base.

45
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,660
ALOY: Wait, what?

46
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,049
SYLENS: That's right.

47
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,930
SYLENS: Fortunately for you, I brought you around to the back way.

48
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,839
SYLENS: It's right through that crevice.

49
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,990
SYLENS: Once you reach the base, you'll see the objective.

50
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,259
SYLENS: A derelict Tallneck that's been extensively modified.

51
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,723
SYLENS: Climb the Tallneck, grafted into the top of its disc
you'll find a module of sorts.

52
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:31,660
SYLENS: Destroy that and the Focus network will crash.

53
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,838
ALOY: So you were part of the Eclipse?

54
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,190
SYLENS: I've never been part of anything.

55
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,000
SYLENS: I serve my own interests always.

56
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,630
SYLENS: But … it is the case that I …

57
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,609
SYLENS: … assisted the Eclipse before I sensed the threat they might become.

58
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,450
SYLENS: It was a mistake that I'm doing what I can to correct.

59
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,849
ALOY: What sort of assistance did you give them?

60
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,339
SYLENS: Head through that crevice, Aloy.

61
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:04,450
SYLENS: You have more important things to do than ask questions.

62
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:12,934
Hrrmph.

63
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,950
ALOY: Gonna be tight.

64
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:28,473
ALOY: Corrupted machines, patrolling like guards.

65
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:32,979
SYLENS: More like soldiers, held in reserve for a war yet to come.

66
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,730
SYLENS: You'll have to get past them.

67
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,609
ALOY: This is the easy way in?

68
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,706
SYLENS: The back way. I didn't say it'd be easy.

69
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,069
ALOY: Explosions in the distance.

70
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,234
SYLENS: Pay them no mind, doesn't concern you.

71
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,759
ALOY: I'll find a use for you.

72
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,155
SYLENS: Getting close now, head for that ridge.

73
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,709
SYLENS: The Tallneck's just over this ridge.

74
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,660
SYLENS: You'll see it when you reach the top.

75
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,779
SYLENS: Now be ready to act fast.

76
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,140
SYLENS: We need to get in and get it done before they raise an alarm.

77
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,150
SYLENS: Here we go.

78
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:04,869
ALOY: You getting this?

79
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,243
ALOY: I see the legs of a Tallneck down there, but no Tallneck.

80
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,549
SYLENS: Damn, the transmitter's been moved.

81
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,319
SYLENS: Check down the ravine to the left, only place it could be.

82
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,721
ALOY: So much for your insider knowledge. Toward the explosions, great.

83
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,419
SYLENS: You've got exactly one shot at this, Aloy.

84
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,950
SYLENS: So spare the sarcasm and make it count.

85
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,497
SYLENS: You see that bridge over the ravine?

86
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:30,339
ALOY: Yep.

87
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:34,262
SYLENS: Memorise its location, there's a rappel point on the side.

88
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:36,000
SYLENS:  That'll be your way out.

89
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:37,439
ALOY: And these Eclipse troopers?

90
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,880
SYLENS: Avoid them. Or kill them, your choice.

91
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,538
SYLENS: The blasting should cover any noise you make.

92
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,660
SYLENS: Find the Tallneck and destroy the module on top.

93
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,339
ALOY: Here we go.

94
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,539
ECLIPSE: It's been weeks since Helis was around. What's he been up to?

95
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,000
ECLIPSE: Terrifying someone I'm sure.

96
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,871
ECLIPSE: The pain of our labour will birth a new reign, a righteous one.

97
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:14,950
ECLIPSE: Something over here!

98
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:26,049
ALOY: Still sniffing around.

99
00:32:44,935 --> 00:32:46,271
ECLIPSE: Contact! 

100
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,802
ECLIPSE: We're dead too if you don't fight!

101
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:02,025
ECLIPSE: Can't afford any more losses, fight!

102
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,950
ECLIPSE: Bleed for the Shadow!

103
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:20,259
ECLIPSE: Farewell, fool.

104
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,700
ALOY: Is there fighting up ahead?

105
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,950
SYLENS: No, it's a mining operation.

106
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:37,069
SYLENS: So long as you're quick it won't affect you.

107
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,165
ALOY: Oh good, another secret.

108
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,660
ALOY: Fresh as it comes.

109
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,460
ALOY: What is this place?

110
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,960
SYLENS: A distraction.

111
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,960
ALOY: There are several datapoints.

112
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,050
ALOY: A mural of Meridian and the Spire.

113
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:53,100
ALOY: This armour, there's only one man big enough to wear this. Helis.

114
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,783
ALOY: This is his shelter? Not exactly fancy.

115
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,382
SYLENS: What would you expect of a fanatic?

116
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,550
SYLENS: His only extravagance is his brutality.

117
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,370
ALOY: So you know him?

118
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,370
SYLENS: Just enough to want to stop him.

119
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,561
HELIS: When sleep refuses to come, I think of our wedding night.

120
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,139
HELIS: How you welcomed me to the marital bed.

121
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:30,710
HELIS: How after, when you fell asleep, I lay there watching your delicate face.

122
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:37,323
HELIS: For all its beauty I detested its fragility.

123
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,765
HELIS: A rage swelled up inside me.

124
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,550
HELIS: I abhored that bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up.

125
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:53,679
HELIS: And that room, the stench of incense,
the fine embroidery, the drapes — all of it, weak.

126
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:03,840
HELIS: I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement,
and lay naked on the stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort.

127
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:12,523
HELIS: But when I woke the next morning,
you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold.

128
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,650
HELIS: Your body stretched beside mine seem chiselled from stone.

129
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:24,947
HELIS: I saw you wake, instantly alert, like an animal ready to strike.

130
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,000
HELIS: You said nothing, you did not have to.

131
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:35,898
HELIS: Already you had shown me beyond doubt that we were meant to be.

132
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,150
HELIS: Never does the Sun show pity.

133
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:54,346
HELIS: And yet, when my wife died in birthing,
and in dying ended the life of my child unborn, I pitied myself.

134
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,559
HELIS: My Lord sensed this.

135
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:04,239
HELIS: But instead of casting me down for weakness,
he cast upon me a radiant beam of honour.

136
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:10,460
HELIS: He ordered my kin buried
in the sacred caves reserved for royals and heroes.

137
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,739
HELIS: Unimaginable.

138
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,925
HELIS: Never again would I doubt that I am the chosen of the Sun.

139
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,858
HELIS: Never again would pity find a place in me.

140
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:23,964
HELIS: Not for myself, or another.

141
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:40,070
HELIS: When I first set eyes on the Buried Shadow I trembled.

142
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,038
HELIS: Was I not the chosen of the Sun?

143
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,690
HELIS: A blazing light of faith to shred and scatter darkness?

144
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,630
HELIS: Was it not my place to destroy this devil?

145
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:57,949
HELIS: But High Priest Bahavas instructed me
in the prophecy and set right my frame of mind.

146
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,681
HELIS: The murder of the true Sun-King broke the cosmic cycle short of completion.

147
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:08,440
HELIS: A whole world cast into darkness, doomed.

148
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:14,559
HELIS: To resume and turn the wheel of time
would require more than Sun and faith.

149
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
HELIS: All forces must combine, all halves of nature join to one cause.

150
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,122
HELIS: Shadow to sun, night to day.

151
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:26,168
HELIS: Even a Buried Shadow wants the wheel to turn.

152
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,030
HELIS: For without a sun in the sky, there can be no shadow.

153
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,329
HELIS: My Lord, the thirteenth king of the Carja Sundom was murdered.

154
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,820
HELIS: Cut down by cowards who mistook firm rule for madness.

155
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:52,030
HELIS: "Ever the strong are beset upon by the weak."

156
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,829
HELIS: So he said, as the traitors launched their assault.

157
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,889
HELIS: As their cannons forged by Oseram filth
toppled the battlements and burst the gates.

158
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,739
HELIS: I would have fought to the end.

159
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:14,907
HELIS: But it was his will, the will of the Sun,
that I lead the prince and queen into the west to safety.

160
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:20,562
HELIS: My Lord did not hesitate. He saw his fate.

161
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:24,440
HELIS: He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink.

162
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:30,212
HELIS: With me he sent kestrels, nobles, Sun Priests, and slaves.

163
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:36,110
HELIS: Killing all that stood in the way, I carved a path to Sunfall.

164
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:41,612
HELIS: There we joined others to gather the strength to take back our home.

165
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:47,829
HELIS: But our strength only faded, until the Buried Shadow was brought to light.

166
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:07,337
HELIS: Every morning I wake to the same nightmare, the same reality.

167
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:13,699
HELIS: Holy Meridian in the hands of profligates, debased.

168
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:21,320
HELIS: The Spire, towering above the horizon,
like in a glittering spike through the centre of my mind.

169
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:28,179
HELIS: Every daybreak in exile is a mark of failure, but the count of days runs thin.

170
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:38,469
HELIS: I will see Meridian retaken, the profligates slaughtered,
a true king restored to the mesa throne.

171
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,429
HELIS: In this I have become an instrument of prophecy.

172
00:40:51,995 --> 00:41:00,000
HELIS: So long as King Itamen languishes at Sunfall coddled by his mother,
he will never learn the true lessons of the Sun.

173
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:06,820
HELIS: I have tried to instruct him,
but the shadow of his mother's influence is upon him.

174
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:12,519
HELIS: I took him to the palace balcony
to behold an offering of sacrifice in the ring.

175
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,130
HELIS: But he showed no thirst for it.

176
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,679
HELIS: He averted his gaze.

177
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,988
HELIS: "Look to the Sun", I told him.

178
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:24,350
HELIS: "Do not shield your eyes. In all things it is absolute."

179
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,130
HELIS: "One day it nurtures life, and the next scorches life away."

180
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,630
HELIS: "It burns the skin of champions and wretches alike."

181
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,081
HELIS: "Never does the Sun show pity."

182
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:43,395
HELIS: "That is the example a Sun King must follow, the example of your father."

183
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,404
HELIS: But before my instruction could take hold, she was there.

184
00:41:49,404 --> 00:41:53,630
HELIS: Clutching him to her robes, burying his face against her breast.

185
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:58,929
HELIS: How is a king to rule, when he cannot even see?

186
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,189
ALOY: Did it!

187
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,100
ALOY: He's a fanatic alright, single-minded.

188
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,401
SYLENS: It gives him a focus that you seem to lack.

189
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:23,500
SYLENS: Now, how about finding that Tallneck?

190
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,517
ALOY: Would not have been easy to drag a Tallneck down this path, why bother?

191
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,377
SYLENS: Just find it and get to the top.

192
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:34,219
SYLENS: Destroy the module and then get out, fast as you can.

193
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,670
ALOY: Sure is a lot of blasting up there, sounds busy.

194
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,339
SYLENS: Busy enough not to notice you, let's hope.

195
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,420
ALOY: I see it.

196
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,248
ALOY: They've built some kind of structure around it.

197
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:57,420
SYLENS: Climb it, the sooner this is done, the better.

198
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,068
ALOY: I don't like this, feels wrong.

199
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:05,827
SYLENS: Everything here is wrong, just get to the module and destroy it.

200
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,131
ALOY: What's this? A signal.

201
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:31,411
FOCUS: Alert. Irregular transmission source detected.

202
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,460
ALOY: I see the module.

203
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:44,975
SYLENS: Good. Now be quick.

204
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:49,518
ALOY: This … this is Hades?

205
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,610
SYLENS: Aloy, this is not the time.

206
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,090
ALOY: It's a Metal Devil.

207
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,961
SYLENS: Open the module's casing, now.

208
00:43:56,961 --> 00:44:00,000
SYLENS: ALOY! Do as I say, or all is lost!

209
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:20,000
HADES: Entity has come here?

210
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,000
HADES: Entity miscalculated.

211
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,265
HADES: Entity cannot destroy me, I am beyond its reach.

212
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,700
ALOY: Maybe you are, but this isn't!

213
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,620
HADES: Destroy the entity!

214
00:45:19,077 --> 00:45:20,610
ALOY: Ugh, what?

215
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,146
SYLENS: Keep moving!

216
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,309
ALOY: Yeah, you think?

217
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,334
SYLENS: Keep moving! KEEP MOVING!

218
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:59,079
ALOY: Talk about a "brave" trail.

219
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,603
ALOY: Almost there!

220
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,534
SYLENS: Keep running!

221
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,502
ALOY: What do you think I'm doing, taking a nap?

222
00:46:16,934 --> 00:46:18,067
ALOY: Oh, come on!

223
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,442
SYLENS: Head left, towards the camp!

224
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,522
SYLENS: The whole base is on high alert.

225
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,309
ALOY: Yeah, I noticed!

226
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,116
ECLIPSE: I missed!

227
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,858
ALOY: Are you kidding me?

228
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:34,423
SYLENS: Run, don't fight!

229
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,300
ALOY: Bridge in sight!

230
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:41,094
SYLENS: That's the way out!

231
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:43,954
ALOY: I know!
