1
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,503
ALOY: Sounds like you need a new chieftain.

2
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:26,760
OUREA:  Ha! There's an idea that's certain to win us friends.

3
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:31,480
Hmm, you said you were a hunter.

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,450
And I'll wager you're not an ordinary one.

5
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,079
It's not impossible, even for an outlander.

6
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,759
And Aratak couldn't refuse the challenge if you were known among the werak.

7
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,149
Wait, uh, me? Challenge Aratak?

8
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,199
I don't want to be chieftain of anything,
much less a bunch of Banuk that don't want me.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,009
But you want to go to Thunder's Drum don't you?

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,741
You heard the spirit, she's suffering, tormented by the Daemon.

11
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,750
She longs to be free.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,759
And perhaps when released from her bonds,
she can give you the answers you seek.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,859
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,719
Fine!

15
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,242
BANUK: Look at what Ohlgrud did to this place.

16
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:40,619
BANUK: Hello.

17
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:16,169
BANUK: I have no interest in the frozen Tallneck.
Living machines are what's important to the hunt.

18
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,250
BANUK: Is there no end to the horrors
the Daemon is willing to commit against us?

19
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,509
These will keep.

20
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,338
Cold, very cold, I get it!

21
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,670
Saving these for the trail.

22
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,040
Save these for the trail.

23
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,850
A fistful of bluegleam's worth braving the cold.

24
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:33,850
BANUK: The White Teeth have come to The Cut.
Not every day you see one of the great weraks.

25
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,750
BANUK: The longer you sit, the darker the colours end up being.

26
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,850
This really catches the eye.

27
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,582
BANUK: It's odd to see new machines in The Cut,
but we mustn't let them frighten us. We're Banuk.

28
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,690
ALOY: Is this what you…
KAMUT: Hush, hush!

29
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,134
A Shaman's secrets are not spoken aloud.

30
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,569
Is this what you wanted me to find?

31
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,379
Bind it to your spear, use it to attach this for now.

32
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,909
You'll find more, I'm sure.

33
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,668
Why are you helping me?

34
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:42,737
The blue light is fading, the machine songs are ending, and…

35
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:47,834
And what does the Conclave do? They sit, they chant, they observe.

36
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,039
No more! We must fight for it.

37
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,900
And you? You are a fighter, we share a cause.

38
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,139
I'm not sure we do.

39
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:00,239
I'm not even sure what the cause is, but I'm grateful.

40
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,435
No need for thanks, only action.

41
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,570
Now I can attach modification parts to my spear.

42
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,558
Works for me. Might as well get started improving my spear.

43
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,389
BANUK: I've heard of your performance at the hunting grounds.

44
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,450
BANUK: Everyone gets lucky occasionally.

45
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,549
BANUK: The Daemon at Thunder's Drum…

46
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,408
Ah, there she is!

47
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,558
There's my other set of hands.

48
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,000
How's your metal cooling, hmm?

49
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,634
My, uh, metal is cooling pretty well Gildun, and yours?

50
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:27,135
Ah, you know, nothing comes out of the forge perfect.

51
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,389
Come, sit, I've got an old delving story that'll turn that red hair white.

52
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,867
Hold that thought, Gildun. Another time, okay?

53
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,300
Anytime you like.

54
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,373
SHAMAN: We remember Banukai.

55
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:51,870
SHAMAN: When the Old Ones were fresh in their graves and our numbers
were still small, it was she who led us through the frozen wastes.

56
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,959
We also remember the Ravenous Tribe
who delighted in sucking the marrow from our broken bones.

57
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:06,281
Everywhere Banukai and her werak fled,
the Ravenous Tribe were never far behind.

58
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:11,589
Seeking a way to defeat them, Banukai went into the wastes
and let the wind whip her cheeks.

59
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,549
And when the cold brought sleep she dreamt of light.

60
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,639
She saw it behind the world, a great calming sheet of icy blue.

61
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,529
And she saw something new.

62
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,799
Herds of machines, each filled with the same blue light.

63
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,839
When she woke, she knew which star to follow.

64
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,674
She walked for many days and nights
until she arrived at a temple built from sparkling ice.

65
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:43,639
At the gates of the temple she was met by the machines
from her dream, who bowed to her as she entered.

66
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:50,409
Inside Banukai discovered the blue light
bubbling from a hole in the snowy earth like a spring.

67
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,779
"You bid me come," she said.

68
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,190
"My people need aid. Will you provide it?"

69
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:07,289
The machines whispered to Banukai,
"we go where the light goes for we are its chosen vessels."

70
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,230
"There is darkness in your heart, it cannot hold the light for long."

71
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,819
"Carry it to your people if you must, but the cost will be great."

72
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,570
Banukai waded into the pool.

73
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:29,751
The light reared like a nest of snakes and struck Banukai,
piercing her skin, filling her up.

74
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:35,216
Banukai did not scream, though she was in agony.

75
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:40,000
Banukai did not collapse, though her limbs shook.

76
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,469
She climbed from the pool and carried the light inside her.

77
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,409
She marched toward home and the machines marched behind her.

78
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:53,308
As she walked, the light struggled to push its way out of her,
but the machines were there to aid her.

79
00:17:53,309 --> 00:18:01,588
She sewed her body shut with their cables,
patched herself with their metal, and kept the light within.

80
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,220
When she arrived the forces of the Ravenous Tribe had surrounded the camp.

81
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,000
Although the light had left her with a thousand wounds, Banukai charged.

82
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,159
And because she held the light, the machines followed.

83
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,038
The Ravenous Tribe killed many, but those in camp rushed to join the battle.

84
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,729
They gathered pieces of the fallen machines and from them fashioned weapons.

85
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,130
And it was with these that Banukai's people
repaid the suffering the Ravenous Tribe had brought upon them.

86
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,124
When quiet descended, Banukai finally fell.

87
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,490
The machines bowed their heads and the werak wept.

88
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,929
The light she'd held within her drifted from her wounds and rose to the sky.

89
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:52,661
And for just a moment, before life left her,
Banukai knew the truth of the blue light.

90
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,242
And she felt peace.

91
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,000
We remember Banukai.

92
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,798
The first to crawl from the cave beneath the world,
who brought the machines to us.

93
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:11,583
When we speak the name of our tribe we remember her.

94
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,559
And we will not forget.

95
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,128
SHAMAN: We remember Banukai.

96
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:38,231
SHAMAN: When the Old Ones were fresh in their graves and our numbers were still small, it was she…

97
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,139
SEKULI: What does the Outlander want?

98
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,889
ALOY: I'm looking for Sekuli.

99
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,018
SEKULI: You found her. Come, come, let's get it over with.

100
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,702
ALOY: Is this swaying or is it just me?

101
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,639
SEKULI: The wood bends with the wind.

102
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,699
ALOY: Quite a view you've got up here.

103
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,759
SEKULI: It's a useful perspective.

104
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,060
SEKULI: How fleeting we are, and the world is so wide.

105
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,220
SEKULI: From up here you can see how the light paints across the land, ever changing.

106
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,250
SEKULI: That's a lesson: all our marks will pass.

107
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,489
That outlook sounds a little depressing for a painter.

108
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,660
Haven't met many artists, have you?

109
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,442
The Banuk rock paintings are impressive, but, um…

110
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,450
SEKULI: You want to know what they mean.

111
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:16,800
SEKULI: That's not the right question, but I'll answer anyway.

112
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,649
Some are a call to the machines,
the sacred shapes you see on metal casings or on a Cauldron door.

113
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,548
Do the machines listen to the call?

114
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,734
I don't know.

115
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:28,259
Others, like mine, are a call to the tribe.

116
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,828
You could say inspiration or prophecy.

117
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:35,500
And sometimes even men listen if the painting is loud enough.

118
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
Have you always been a painter?

119
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,189
I've always painted, but I wasn't a painter until I was driven out of Ban-Ur.

120
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,779
Up there the markings are eternal.

121
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:48,909
They paint over the same lines, the same colours, over and over.

122
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,680
As a child, I learned from copying them.

123
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,500
As I grew, my heart sank at the familiarity.

124
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,950
Song's Edge needs new stories.

125
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:02,779
I scrubbed its past off this rock to start anew, but a new start needs new colours.

126
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,400
Fresh pigments like none have seen.

127
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,834
Ourea said you two were friends.

128
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:11,579
I paint about what I feel now, not the way things used to be.

129
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,867
Ourea understood, most Banuk didn't.

130
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,774
I would have been exiled if she hadn't had Aratak take me into their werak.

131
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:21,734
These pigments you want, where should I look for them?

132
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:27,959
Salts gather at the edges of geysers and hot pools,
crystals cling to the rocks and cliffs.

133
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,338
I'll see what I can find for you.

134
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,598
Seek out the vibrant ones,
a spring of sudden colour among snow or rock or metal.

135
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,650
That's its own reward. But I'd reward you as well.

136
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:54,383
These are perfect, and like all perfect things,
they must be watered down or ground into a paste.

137
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,130
Way of the world.

138
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,170
I'll see you again.

139
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,806
If you do find any pigments out there, don't put them on your tongue.

140
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,990
I'm not even going to ask.

141
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,440
I'll bet my name's all over Song's Edge.

142
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,509
Might be time to challenge Aratak.

143
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,269
My people have been telling tales of your accomplishments.

144
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:28,660
Seems you have taken a special interest in our stretch of snow, outlander.

145
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,231
Yes, and apparently this is the only way I'll get to see all of it.

146
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,950
Is this a challenge?

147
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:40,251
For the werak.

148
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:43,639
You? Ha! This must be a joke!

149
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,088
OUREA: It is not a joke Aratak!

150
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:56,160
ARATAK: Now I see. The outlander's your pawn.

151
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,307
ARATAK: And with you backing her claim I have no choice but to accept.

152
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,378
ARATAK: I expected better of you, sister.

153
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:09,900
OUREA: It was you who forbid me from Thunder's Drum, brother.

154
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,599
ALOY: Brother and sister?

155
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:17,069
ALOY: This is a little more complicated than I thought.

156
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,920
ARATAK: No, it's simple.

157
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,819
ARATAK: You will meet me at the Frostfigures
and I'll put a quick end to this mockery.

158
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,427
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

159
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:39,549
Yeah, I suppose you do.

160
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,002
ALOY: So why didn't you tell me that you and Aratak are siblings?

161
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,549
I thought I wouldn't have to.

162
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,328
I'm surprised Aratak brought it up in front of a stranger.

163
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:52,089
He must be very angry.

164
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,867
I'm not always best judge of…

165
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:55,416
People?

166
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,579
OUREA: I prefer the company of spirits.

167
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,469
Or simply my own.

168
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,719
I didn't want you to think of our pilgrimage of some sort of family squabble.

169
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,239
It's much more important than that.

170
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,809
It's bold, I'll give you that, going after your own brother.

171
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,838
He gave me no choice.

172
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,098
He thinks I'm a child to be shoved to the back of the hunt.

173
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,690
He would forbid me from my destiny.

174
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:23,352
And yet part of me did it knowing he would forgive me, eventually.

175
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,930
He always does.

176
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,234
Family drama aside, what's this challenge meant to be anyway?

177
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:33,077
You and Aratak will hunt machines at the Frostfigures.

178
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:35,480
OUREA: The victor will be the fastest.

179
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,479
OUREA: It won't be easy.

180
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,209
Nothing about this has been so far.

181
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,450
When you meet us at the starting point, I'll tell you more.

182
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,534
It will be simpler to explain from the base of the hills.

183
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:49,049
Ourea, it's not about who's related to who.

184
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,468
I want to know what's inside Thunder's Drum.

185
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:56,349
The spirit, the Daemon, and how it all connects the machines.

186
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:01,600
But if we're gonna go through with this, I need you to be straight with me.

187
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,759
I … underestimated you.

188
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,490
And Aratak.

189
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,098
I won't make that mistake again.

190
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,950
See you at the Frostfigures then.

191
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:26,000
So, off to risk my life in order to take charge of a Banuk hunting band.

192
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,920
Just what I always wanted.

193
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,000
Frostfigures here I come.

194
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,349
BANUK: These new machines, another horror visited upon us by the Daemon.

195
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,000
BANUK: No reason to leave The Cut,
the weather only gets hotter as you venture south.

196
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,200
OK, the Frostfigures should be just up there.

197
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,650
The Frostfigures. Aratak and Ourea must be close.

198
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,049
ARATAK: Outlander!

199
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,289
ARATAK: I have prevailed over such challenges before and fear none.

200
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,349
ARATAK: But this one is foolish.

201
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,589
ARATAK: You are not Banuk.

202
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,640
ARATAK: You do not understand my responsibilities.

203
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,307
I ask you, one hunter to another, withdraw.

204
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,359
Will you let us go to Thunder's Drum?

205
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:50,369
You haven't seen what's up there, outlander.

206
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,210
I will not risk my sister's life again.

207
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,538
Then we'd better get on with this.

208
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,869
So be it!

209
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,623
I will bury your insolent claim in the frozen ground!

210
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:01,601
OUREA: Enough!

211
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:04,967
OUREA: Let us begin.

212
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:13,104
OUREA: To hunt, to strive,
that is the way of the Banuk and of the contest before you.

213
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,212
OUREA: You will climb the Frostfigures from the east, Aratak from the west.

214
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,420
OUREA: Each trail wends its way through deadly machines.

215
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,190
OUREA: Hunters from the werak will be posted along the way.

216
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,049
OUREA: They will hail you, calling out machines for you to slay.

217
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,299
OUREA: Your hunt will take you around the ridge to the centre,
where you must descend to the valley for your final kill.

218
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:46,973
OUREA: Each time after your prey has fallen, you must launch
a beacon such as this so that all our kin will see your progress.

219
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,465
ALOY: Kill machines, launch balloons. Got it.

220
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,119
ALOY: So, the first of us to launch third balloon wins?

221
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,500
OUREA: Well, yes.

222
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,765
OUREA: But as challenger your path to victory is harder.

223
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,915
OUREA: If even one of your beacons comes in after Aratak's, he prevails.

224
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:21,349
ARATAK: [laughs] You had your chance, outlander.

225
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,460
ALOY: So did you.

226
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,460
OUREA: The hunt begins on my mark.

227
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,849
Now!

228
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,849
All right, gotta head up that mountain.

229
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:51,960
Looks like there are a few ways to go up, and those rock paintings mark the path.

230
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,250
Okay, up we go.

231
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,960
I seem to be on the right path.

232
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,608
C'mon Aloy, time is wasting.

233
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:04,150
Almost to the top.

234
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,650
BANUK: Alright challenger, you need to take out the herd below, every machine.

235
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,055
ALOY: Kill a herd, okay, I can do that.

236
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:06,940
BANUK: I've dropped a ladder for you! Climb on up and launch your marker!

237
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:16,978
ALOY: Alright, here we go.

238
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,510
BANUK: Now climb the ridge and launch your balloon.

239
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,491
Aratak knows what he's doing. No time to waste.

240
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,829
BANUK: Take the rappel point to the next challenge.

241
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:50,000
BANUK: Two Bellowbacks ahead challenger.

242
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,739
BANUK: Kill them both, none of the other machines matter.

243
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,593
ALOY: Alright, two dead Bellowbacks coming up!

244
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,245
Right on target!

245
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,551
ALOY: Got 'em both.
BANUK: Here challenger, raise your marker!

246
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,249
ALOY: Now where's that balloon?

247
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,413
BANUK: Come on over here and launch your balloon!

248
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,839
ALOY: I'm ahead, but only by a little. I gotta get moving.

249
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,414
BANUK: Now take the zip line and work your way down to the valley.

250
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,658
ALOY: Storm's kicking up. Can't see much.

251
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:33,394
ALOY: Close now.

252
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,371
ALOY: Almost down.

253
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,002
ALOY: Alright, to the last challenge.

254
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,719
ARATAK: Something's wrong.

255
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:09,510
ARATAK: My kin should be here, driving in our final quarry.

256
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,586
BANUK: They're right behind us!

257
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:09,252
That's it, I'm already gone.

258
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,234
I think I'm in the clear.

259
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:10,710
Makes this a little easier.

260
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:32,748
SIGNUTAI: So it's true. Frostclaws, from Thunder's Drum.

261
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,630
RUATUK: The attack cut short the competition.

262
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,476
RUATUK: Naturally, there can be no result. It is void.

263
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,590
ARATAK: You saw what she did!

264
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:58,067
ARATAK: She defeated the machines, not I.

265
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,107
ARATAK: It is proven, she is the better hunter.

266
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:14,234
ARATAK: We are Banuk. Survive, prevail, what else matters?

267
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,562
ARATAK: My blood is in your teeth.

268
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,200
ARATAK: I take my place behind you on the hunt.

269
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,526
OUREA: No more hunters may make the ascent to Thunder's Drum.

270
00:49:40,526 --> 00:49:44,389
OUREA: The way is closed to all but the chieftain and myself.

271
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,809
ARATAK: It is not my place, but I would ask a boon.

272
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:53,639
ARATAK: To accompany you, and my sister.

273
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:58,867
OUREA: It might be permitted, but only if you do as I say.

274
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,190
ALOY: No.

275
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,179
ALOY: Only if you do as I say.

276
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,510
OUREA: Thunder's Drum awaits.

277
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,111
OUREA: There's a camp at its base, Longnotch it's called.

278
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:24,514
OUREA: Meet us there when you're ready… chieftain.

279
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,380
A new outfit and a weapon like Aratak's.

280
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:44,358
I guess the chieftain gets the chieftain's gear.

281
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,389
And now to Longnotch. Nothing left to keep me from Thunder's Drum.

282
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,619
Think of summer sun, breeze through the trees.
