Theodor Ted Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and
business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions, FAZ, the
largest corporation of all time, the world's wealthiest individual, and the
first-ever trillionare. Born and raised in Salt Lake City Utah, he enrolled at
the University of California Los Angeles where he studied business for two
years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAZ. Though it struggled at first,
the company broke through at the end of the troubled 20 30s with its popular
lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous
line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 20
40s "Claw-back." At the end of that decade, FAZ opened a military defense
branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053.
The success of FAZ has made Mr. Faro the world's best-known businessman, one
of its most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and
international affairs.
