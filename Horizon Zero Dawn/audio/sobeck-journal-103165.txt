Halloween.

Travis came by trick-or-treating - dressed up like me. Should've seen that
coming. I gave him a half-eaten packet of dandy wafers as a "treat" and kicked
him out... but not before he invited me to some kind of "Italian horror
extravaganza" he organized for Zed Dee staff. Seriously. As though there isn't
enough horror in the world already.

Anyway, I was already scheduled to fly out here to G Prime for final
inspections with Herres and the President's delegation. Ted was here too, and
he was not looking good. Kept fidgeting and couldn't seem to look me in the
face without blinking. I was relieved when he boarded his vert and flew back to
"Thebes" (gag). Though I guess I shouldn't complain... if he wants to build
himself a "deluxe shelter" to ride out the apocalypse, let him. Keeps him out
of Elysium and away from me.

Herres stuck around long enough to give me a detailed briefing on the
strategic situation. Basically, we've entered the terminal phase. (As though
the color of the sky when I was flying over here wasn't clue enough.) Another
two or three weeks, and the atmosphere won't be breathable. The last vestiges
of European and West-African civ brigades are trapped with their backs
against the Atlantic. The swarm that scuttled across Antarctica is crossing
the straits of Magellan, about to start its death crawl up South America
towards the Amazon.

<p>(All the work we did to reconstitute the rain forest...
and it comes to this.)</p>

And advance elements of the Pacific swarms are already
skirmishing with units on the Cal-Mar seawall.

The noose is tightening. Projections show we can still finish in time, but the
margin of error is plus or minus 10 days - not a good spread. If the plague breaks
through ahead of schedule... Well, it just can't. I will not let that happen.

Enough writing. I need to get back to Zero Dawn.
