  Esteemed lords and ladies of the Sun-Court, honored Khanes and patrons,
</p>
<p>
  Your concerns regarding the continuing Derangement of the machines are noted.
  Though many seasons have passed since the first sightings of this frightful
  change, the Sun-King is well aware that this is no longer a matter of reports
  from border patrols and Hunters Lodge expeditions. One needs only look to the
  abandoned estatelands, indeed, the estates you owned, left for the Jewel to
  reclaim, or to the empty freeholds of the common Carja folk.
</p>
<p>
  Know that the Sun-King has taken every measure to protect holy Meridian and
  the Maizelands with renewed patrols. As for entreating the Sun, we believe the
  cause of the Derangement cannot be the Sun's displeasure alone, for the years
  of sacrifice under Sun-King Jerahn produced no noticeable effect on the
  machines. His Luminance and the Sun-Priests are in agreement that, even if
  this is an ordeal set for us by the Sun, our suffering will not be reduced
  with blood.
</p>
<p>
  For your edification, I will recount what we have observed of the Derangement.
  Of the simpler machines, the herd creatures, the gallopers, the
  scuttlers,  where once they fled at the sight of men, now they are more likely
  to charge. The larger creatures, once only a menace to the inebriated and
  foolhardy, can be seen to lunge at the unwary with murderous intent.
</p>
<p>
  This is to say nothing of the coming of the Sawtooth, or its metal brethren:
  the Ravager, the Stalker, or that terrible giant the Thunderjaw. Each one has
  proved a more capable killer of men than the last, each wielding a wider array
  of strange weapons. The wilds are no longer safe due to the hostility of these
  new machines, though to date they have not attacked a settlement within the Sundom.
</p>
<p>
  Outlanders have brought no shortage of fanciful explanations for this
  behavior. Some suggest that the machines have come to resent men for hunting
  them. Yet such a thing has never been witnessed among beasts of flesh and
  blood, and they are proven to be more capable of thinking and memory.
</p>
<p>
  Carja hunters and Osser am tinkers alike have attempted to understand the
  phenomenon by inspecting felled machines. But these appear no different to
  those harvested many years before Derangement began, with the same assortments
  of wires, braiding, lenses, hearts, and so on. When these parts are subjected
  to the light of the Sun, or to Osser am experiments with fire and spark, they
  react as they always have.
</p>
<p>
  The Bannook, however, claim to have recorded a change in the 'machine songs' of
  the 'machine spirits', suggesting that these have become increasingly
  discordant. The Sun-King has sent envoys to Ban-oor to learn more, in the hopes
  that their mysticism might contain a truth when the rational light of the Sun
  is brought to bear upon it.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the Sun-King graciously welcomes your own contributions to study of
  the Derangement, asking only that they are delivered in written form, and not
  during royal audience. His Luminance also hopes to dissuade you from
  participating in machine hunts during these uncertain times. The strength of a
  united Sun-Court is the strength of all Carja.
</p>
<p>
  Respectful Tashadi, court envoy
