From Major Garrow,
To Gen. Aaron Herres,
Subject, UltraWeave Progress.

General,

You wanted fast, cheap, and good, and that's what we're going to deliver. By
using a flexible nano-fiber weave instead of plating, and enhancing protection
with a 400 eV hard light micro-projector, we've reduced our testing cycle from
weeks to days, and I'm confident we can get the suit out by next month, with
enough production to cover dozens of elite units at least. Better yet, it
will be half the weight, half the cost, and offer twice the mobility. All we
need is the balance of our funding, a few more techs, and another experienced
test subject. I know resources are stretched to the breaking point, but any
more delays will jeopardize the schedule, so please advise ASAP.

May God be with you and Jane in these dark times.

Semper Fi,
Major Garrow
