My loyal customer Aylund Forgeman,

I hope your plans for a forge in upper Meridian are moving forward, and we're
honored you chose us to provide the Blaze you need. We've received payment for
the third shipment, and we are most thankful for your prompt remuneration.
Unfortunately, our hunters are struggling to cover the order. We apologize for
the delay, but this is an unusually large request. As soon as we have it,
we'll deliver it to your warehouse as promised.

With utmost respect,

Garund Huntmaster
