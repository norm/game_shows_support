FROM Patrick Brochard-Klein,
TO Elisabet Sobeck,
SUBJECT, Eff Zed Chambers.

The ectogenic chambers arrived two days ago.

I've spent the last 36 hours examining them and poring over technical
documentation.

They're a revelation. Astonishing.

I don't know what you had to give Far Zenith in trade to get these chambers,
but it was worth it. In a single leap, their embryologists have vaulted past
fifty years of technological shortcomings. The risks of ECMO - resolved.
Nutrition delivery - resolved. Hormonal stability - resolved. Twelve other
risk areas - resolved.

Before I examined these chambers, I considered the Odyssey to be a fool's
errand. But if the rest of Eff Zeds technology is at this level, well... a human
colony around Sirius doesn't seem so impossible after all.

Mass fabrication of the chambers will present a number of challenges, but I'm
confident they can be resolved. I'm going to rest for a few hours, then get
back to it. Expect a fabrication plan within 48 hours.
