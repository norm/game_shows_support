Tektuk: There is much I would confess to you, but one thing I cannot. I did not kill
Signak our chieftain, who claimed to be your father. That night I was alone in
my tent, drunk with cold wine, dreaming as I always did, of Ili your mother
and her sunset smile. You will never hear my testament, and my offering will
never touch the warmth of your hands. But I paint my mark in the light of
truth. I know what I am guilty of, and what I am not. I hope against hope that
in your heart, you know the same.
