Just kidding – they have no idea what we're doing up here. Mention of

By Holochatter Staff – May 2, 2063

A HOLOCHATTER EXCLUSIVE

Yellowstone's gates have now stood closed for fifteen years, to the sorrow of
hikers, campers, and bird-watchers. For ages, no one knew why – but now,
Holochatter has the answer. A scientist interviewed for this story explains it
all.

“In the Die-Off years, Yellowstone Park was one of Earth's few relatively
unspoiled ecosystems,” shares the scientist. “This made it an ideal testing
ground for bioterror weapons.”

Holochatter has obtained copies of data showing that the US government used
Yellowstone Park's animals for secret experiments with deadly genetically
altered viruses, tested on the park’s wildlife and easily spread to humans.
Rumor has it that this project is codenamed “Firebreak.”

“After the deadly Naysay Doom attack in 2039, countries cracked down on
genetic testing. But even as it became illegal, research on synthetic plagues
continued under the radar in many jurisdictions,” the scientist we interviewed
says.

Over the years, people living close to Yellowstone Park have at various times
reported spotting military-grade drones near their homes. These drones are
believed to patrol the park's borders, shooting down diseased deer and
contaminated coyotes before they wander into nearby towns and [DATA CORRUPTED]
