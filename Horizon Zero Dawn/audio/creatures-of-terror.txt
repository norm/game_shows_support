ground for bioterror weapons.”

Holo chatter has obtained copies of data showing that the US government used
Yellowstone Park's animals for secret experiments with deadly genetically
altered viruses, tested on the park’s wildlife and easily spread to humans.
Rumor has it that this project is codenamed “Firebreak.”

“After the deadly Nay Say Doom attack in 2039, countries cracked down on
genetic testing. But even as it became illegal, research on synthetic plagues
continued under the radar in many jurisdictions” the scientist we interviewed
says.

Over the years, people living close to Yellowstone Park have at various times
reported spotting military-grade drones near their homes. These drones are
believed to patrol the park's borders, shooting down diseased deer and
