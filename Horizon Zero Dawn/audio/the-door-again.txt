Okay, I've been hearing that some of our staff members are having trouble with
our state-of-the-art ultra-secure and absolutely necessary lambent orbicular
door access. So here's the ess ell oh double yew version, again:

The thingy in the middle is the source node. Turn it on.
Yeah <break time="60ms" /> I know.
Hard <break time="60ms" /> right?

Then you've got to turn the other nodes so that the data stream containing
your credentials gets back to the source. Some nodes are used to buffer
corrupt or suspect data, so avoid those. Shouldn't be too tough,
because <break time="60ms" />
you know <break time="60ms" />
they're red. Like a stop sign. I'm guessing you were taught this in
preschool, but with this crowd, who knows?

Anyway, that's it. Get the data stream back to the source, and the door opens.
It's really not that tough, but if you need me to I'll hold your hand while
you give it a try - actually, scratch that. Do it yourself, I'm not going to
touch your hand.
