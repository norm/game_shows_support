FROM Samina Ebah Gee,
TO Travis Tate,
CC Elisabet Sobeck,
SUBJECT, Archive Abuse.

Mr. Tate,

This mail concerns APOLLO Archive Submission #000023876 - your 666th
submission in just five days... and oh, what a doozy.

Despite earlier warnings re inappropriate materials, you chose to submit 265
"holographic re-masters" of "acknowledged classics of extreme exploitation
cinema."

Allow me then to thank you - on two counts:

1) For giving me the pleasure of rejecting your submission, thereby consigning
your favorite Eastern European torture flicks and their ilk to the dust heap
of oblivion. It truly warms my heart to know that I have saved future humanity
from the ordeal of experiencing not just one, but all sixteen installments
of "Making a Millipede." (Don't worry, the Pasolini material has already been
preserved. Extreme, perhaps, but art.)

2) For clarifying a concept that has so long been ambiguous and ethically
fraught for archivists such as myself: the definition of "obscenity." You have
freed me from the subjective quagmire embodied in Judge Potter's famous
utterance, "I know it when I see it." Thanks to you, I can now apply a single
objective criterion: "If Travis Tate submitted it, it's obscene."

Accordingly, I have directed APOLLO staff to summarily reject all of your
future submissions, sight unseen.

Perhaps you might invest the time you would have spent preparing further
submissions on, oh, I don't know - your assigned work? We have a world to
save, after all... or the rest of us do anyway.

Dr. Samina Ebah Gee
