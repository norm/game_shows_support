O Sun, this may be my last record in a cold and friendless land!

To your ears, I admit my mistake following in the Well-Traveled Aram's
footsteps, lacking his experience or snowshoes. Yet I had always dreamed of
seeing the land of the Banuk for myself! For my folly I have been buffeted by
blizzards, chased by machines, and pressed to what must be the very gates of
Ban-Ur.

I trust there are watchtowers above, and that the Banuk will not leave a
traveler to his death. But the wind drowns out my calls for aid, and any sign
I make is fast extinguished.

My only hope is to huddle here and wait for a break in the snow, even as I
hear my pursuers drawing ever closer. O Sun, should this be the end, see to it
that my worldly possessions are distributed equally among my five cousins, and
my flower garden in Brightmarket is watered regularly (twice daily for the
Rust-Bells) in my memory--
