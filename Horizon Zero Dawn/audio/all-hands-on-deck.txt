Gina,

Ever hear of the Melville Island Fruit Association? Neither had I, until they
filed suit against us this morning. Apparently there's a little island
paradise off the coast of Australia, population 2700, all of whom hate us, now
that a stray Hartz-Timor unit is chowing down on their largest mango orchard.
That brings the official count of Hartz-Timor related lawsuits to 127, most of
them from private companies, but also a bunch from individuals nation states
and NGOs. And that's not even counting the mother of all liability claims from
Hartz itself. Call every external firm we've ever used, then call their
competitors. We're going to need every corporate defense lawyer we can find
who's still half soba and on the bar.
