Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist, roboticist,
and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 21st
century. Born and raised outside Carson City Nevada, she enrolled at Stanford
University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer
Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial
Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro
Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to
Chief Scientist at the age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot
designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and
detoxification efforts of "The Claw-back" decade, propelling FAZ to the
forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAZ, protesting
the company's pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded
Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to "life-positive" robotics and other
technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world's largest suppliers of
green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel
Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.
