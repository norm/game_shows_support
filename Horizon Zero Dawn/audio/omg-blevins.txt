Anita Sandoval personal log.

If Blevins reconfigures the pattern on the lambent orbicular door access one
more time, I'm going to vomit all over it. Sure, I don't want some gift shop
employee rooting around in the Firebreak facility, but these measures aren't
about security. They're about control.

I wonder if Blevins gets in early to watch everybody try to solve the new
pattern, perched over his little camera array in his big-boy office? What a
bridge troll. You'd think that a fraction of his fancy drone budget could go
toward buying him some classier body spray.

God help me and Kenny if he ever finds out about us.
