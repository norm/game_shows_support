Attn: All staff

At an assembly of our country's finest scientific minds, recruited to address
a grave threat to national safety, it would be fair to expect more mature
conduct than that demonstrated yesterday in the canteen.

Mr. Blevins plays a crucial role in the successful execution of Firebreak, and
is due the respect both of his title and of his many contributions to the
project.

Any further interference in the menu boards will necessitate my direct
personal involvement.
