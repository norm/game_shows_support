Must have been sometime in the spring of 2047, about six months after the main
facility opened. We were behind schedule and new data indicated that an
incident was close, maybe only weeks away. I was exhausted, losing weight,
barely speaking except to give orders.

I passed by Anita in the battery depot. She looked at me and frowned, then
pulled me into this room and kissed me. A long kiss, the best kind... I
can still remember the feel of her hand on the back of my neck. After, she
looked at me and smiled, and went back to work without saying a word. I'll
never forget that moment. Her touch, her unspoken generosity.

After she left the project, I spent years beating myself up for not keeping
her somehow. Every time I ran into her at a conference, I felt thrilled and
lost and confused, all at the same time. Always hoping we might have a few
drinks and... well, rekindle.

It was only after I saw her onstage in a holo in '58, accepting the
MindChallenge award in Austin (with Elisabet Sobeck presenting no less),
glowing and happy and fulfilled, that it dawned on me that I hadn't done
anything wrong at all.

I could finally see that she had what she wanted, and it simply wasn't me.
