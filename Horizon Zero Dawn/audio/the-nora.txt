Rumors of the Nora
by the Well-Traveled Aram
</p>
<p>
Readers, many times I have been asked to describe that most fearsome of
barbarian tribes, the Nora of the Savage East. So ferocious are the rumors of
these people, you might think it was they who raided us during the dark times
of the Mad Sun-King, and not the opposite. Well dear readers, though I
possess bravery, there is a shadow-length between bravery and certain
death, and it is certain death that awaits any who trespass on the Sacred Land
of the Nora.
</p>
<p>
However, I have traveled beyond Daytower into the snow-dusted hinterlands of
the Savage East, and on to the very edge of Nora territory, now the site of a
hardscrabble trading camp known as Hunter's Gathering. There, sat around an
open fire with outlanders and uncouths, I was able to gather tales and
eye-witness accounts of what might be seen within the valley of the
warrior-women.
</p>
<p>
They told me another day's travel south lies the Mother's Crown, a name that
suggests something grander than the fort of tree-trunks and log cabins that
was described to me. Still, I was assured it squats most imposingly upon a
rocky outcrop, far above rushing rapids and white-capped falls. From its
ramparts a series of watchtowers stretch back across the mountains, and at any
sign of approach, flaming arrows arc into the air between them. (For a tribe
so concerned with their precious wilds, I expected less careless behavior!)
</p>
<p>
Those interlopers stout or foolhardy enough to approach after this display
are turned back with another flight of arrows, this time aimed just above
their heads. The outlanders, chuckling, agreed that if a Carja showed their
colors the arrows would fly lower, and that even soldiers behind Daytower's
walls grumble about being ambushed and devoured by Nora warriors.
</p>
<p>
I corrected them that it was the Tenarkth, not the Nora, who are known to
engage in cannibalism. In fact, the Nora have only been seen to chew the bark
from trees, the tough plants from the ground, and drink strange herbal brews.
I proposed that they may well be forbidden from eating meat, except at their
strange feminine rites beneath the Moon.
</p>
<p>
Yes, in the benighted land of the Nora, the natural way of things goes
inverted. Women rule men, and all the might of Carja metal can be deflected by
logs leather and hides. Ruins filled with bounteous artifacts go untouched,
and great stretches of farmable land are left uncultivated. Only the
machines, which the Nora greatly mistrust after some ancestral conflict or
another, seem untroubled by this rampant strangeness. Father Sun has no place
here, and I would not be surprised to find the Nora's woman-god to be the Moon
itself.
</p>
<p>
Though it is Nora women who so famously feature in tales of encounters with
the tribe, men have also been sighted bearing the outlandish hair and
blue-painted markings of Nora warriors. It is my understanding, from reading
older studies of the tribe, that a ritual known as The Proving, allows men to
battle one another to gain favor from their rulers.
</p>
<p>
My curiosity to witness this and other Nora rituals sadly goes unsated, but it
is my hope that His Luminance will extend an offer of alliance to these
mysterious barbarians. So emboldened by the Sun-King's generosity, and the
knowledge that I would travel with many many well-armored blazons, I would
gladly gather a first-hand account for the benefit of my readers. Indeed, I
plan to employ a female scribe, who might allow better parley between the Nora
and I on such an occasion. (A better path for a young Carja woman than working
as a seller for the Osser am metal-merchants in town, no?)
</p>
<p>
Until such a Sun-touched time comes though, I can only share with you copies
from the extensive collection of sketches I have gathered over the years, mere
glimpses of these bizarre savage and yet still strangely alluring womenfolk.
