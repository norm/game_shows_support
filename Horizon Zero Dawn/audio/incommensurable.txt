PERSONAL LOG:

I had an argument with Kenny this afternoon. When a couple's first fight
hinges on the Turing Act, you know you're dealing with some real sexy nerds.

I won the argument... I guess. But I'm less concerned whether or not I can
pull this off than with the ethical implications of succeeding. I promised
Kenny that the suite of coping mechanisms I've designed will help manage any
emotional fallout from the software, but privately, I'm less confident. I'm a
programmer, not a shrink.

The minutiae of roboethics do start to seem less relevant when a refusal to
supply Firebreak with the necessary conditions for its success comes at the
cost of millions of lives. It's worth putting one consciousness at risk to
save so many others, isn't it?

Ugh. Trying to solve this with numbers makes me feel like a sociopath.
