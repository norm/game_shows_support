Funeral for an Obsolete Future: An Odyssey to Nowhere
</p><p>
PARIS, July 7, 2057. Twenty-five persons from five nations stand before the
offices of Odyssey*EuroWest, hands clasped solemnly at their waists or held
stiffly at their sides. Some are politicians, some are businessmen (these
days, is there a difference?), some are scientists. Slowly, Gerhardt Weitz
steps to the podium. "I regret to announce that as of today, the Odyssey is
no more. What exists of the vessel will be abandoned in orbit. All personnel
will collect severance income and be released from their contracts. The sad
fact is that our species' greatest hope for an extra-planetary future was
never able to escape the gravity of terrestrial all-too-human conflicts."
Weitz sighs. "Perhaps the innovations we pioneered will help improve the lives
of future generations. Time will tell."
