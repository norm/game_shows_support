Personal log

Could get some demolition bots in here and level the structure. Might be
something of value in the walls, copper wire or something. But that's about
all we're going to get out of this dump. Hell, or just let it rot out here for
all I care.

Oh, uh, one more thing? That Jephords lady. Marni Jephords. Operations
Manager? While we have access to the National Park Department employee
registry, let's put a no-hire flag on her account. Teach her not to get lippy
with her superiors.
