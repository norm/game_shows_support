From Ted Faro, To Paula Vassara, Subject, Spiritual Summit
</p><p>
Paula,
</p><p>
Recent events have sharpened my perspective, and I think that I, and FAZ in
general, have been neglecting the spiritual side of things. Not under any
specific religious framework of course, but in a more general sense, as in
not giving enough thought to our shared values hopes and aspirations for the
afterlife. I'd like you to reach out to religious leaders of every stripe with
the intention of scheduling a conference soon. Very soon. I'll have more
thoughts about the agenda later, but for now let's put out some feelers and
see if we can lock something in. Make it a big tent, no kooks, but anyone
with a credible audience. Let's go deluxe, make it clear we'll spare no
expense.
</p><p>
Thanks. Ted.
