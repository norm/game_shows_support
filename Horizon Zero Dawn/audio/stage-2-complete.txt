SUBJECT: First stage of main facility complete

Attn: All staff

It's with pride that I announce the completion of the first level of
infrastructure on our primary facility. This compound will be the nerve center
for our project, and will require the team's continued best efforts to realize
by the deadline. But even though there is much more to be done, you should be
pleased with all you've accomplished so far.

Please find attached a detailed plan for mustering out of the auxiliary space,
which will serve as a contingency site as we proceed with the main facility.
90% of our personnel must be relocated by 5 pm Wednesday. If your name does
not appear on the assignment list, please email Marisa, with me in CC.

Your dedication talent and intelligence remain daily sources of inspiration.
 
Dr. Kenny Chau
Project Director
