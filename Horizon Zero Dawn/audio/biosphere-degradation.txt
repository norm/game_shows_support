Report, Biosphere Degradation, August 2065. Confidential.
</p><p>
<emphasis>CHIEF FINDINGS</emphasis>
</p><p>
Despite increased tactical proficiency of elite and civilian guard units and
many hard-won engagements in the Central European, Antarctic, and "Pacific
reach" theaters, the Faro Plague's rate of advance has not slowed, nor has its
biomass consumption rate.
</p><p>
Damage to the biosphere has already exceeded 2038 levels by every measure, and
grows worse by the day.
</p><p>
Extinction Timeline projections remain unchanged, with oh ay cee predicted for
mid-November 2065, annihilation of exposed human populations in February 2066,
extinction of macrobiotic land organisms by the end of March 2066, and
extinction of marine life in early 2068.
</p><p>
Continued secrecy re Project Zero Dawn, the utter silence regarding its
mechanisms of action and completion date, make it impossible to predict Zero
Dawn's impact (or lack of impact) on the Extinction Timeline.
</p><p>
<emphasis>ATMOSPHERIC COLLAPSE</emphasis>
</p><p>
Atmospheric oxygen depletion and toxic emissions remain the greatest
environmental threat to Operation Enduring Victory as well as the wider
civilian population and animal life. Operational Atmospheric Collapse (oh ay
cee) is currently predicted for mid-November 2065, after which military
personnel will require rebreathing apparatuses to operate in the open, and
civilians will only be able to survive inside sealed structures. [The
requirements for air scrubbing and recycling in facilities is addressed in
Addendum ay linked to this report.]
</p><p>
<emphasis>POTABLE WATER SHORTAGES</emphasis>
</p><p>
Major water treatment facilities are already struggling to process water
sources compromised by rainfall heavily contaminated by toxins emitted by the
consumption of the Eastern Hemisphere. Following the necessary shutdown of all
nano-scrubbing functionality, waste water recycling is already beyond
capacity.
</p><p>
<emphasis>MILITARY RESPONSE ESCALATION</emphasis>
</p><p>
Addenda linked to this document cover the short-term effects of 'scorched
earth' engagements in defense of the Western Seaboard and the ongoing effects
of the Oceanic Economic Zone's use of nuclear weapons to delay the enemy's
initial advance across the Pacific theater
