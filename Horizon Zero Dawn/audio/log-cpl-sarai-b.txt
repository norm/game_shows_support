Last night we got talking about D-Day '55. I was a kid then, only a few years
out of boot camp. General assembly in a drone hangar, summer and the sky was
bare, the heat was killer. They say U.S. human combat forces are being
disbanded. All automated now, we're last cycle's tech, out like the old-net. A
million more on basic, in a century recession. Could be you'll help build the
robots that took your jobs. Or if you know how to handle a power suit, you
could find a place that still uses manual labor. Maybe in the oh ee zee, or China,
where you're not our problem. 'Low suicide risk', it said in my discharge
file.
