Looking back, I thought '64 was shaping up to be a pretty good year. No more
drinking and no more mercenary seck work. Stripping offshore wind farms for the
oh ee zee, just me and a plasma cutter, 400 feet above sea level. Then I got the
recall alert. Red them up on a turbine in the smell of cooking ozone. They
covered every angle, better pay, amnesty for any commbine wars you'd fought in,
guaranteed citizenship... We should have thought "OK, what's the catch?" But
what we did think was "I guess we're better than the bots after all." Big talk
from Herres about pride and duty - smart guy. He was right. I'd been proud to
be a U.S. soldier. I jumped at the chance to be one again. And look what I
landed in.
