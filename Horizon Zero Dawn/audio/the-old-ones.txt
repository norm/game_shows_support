  <emphasis>Myths of the Old Ones</emphasis>
</p>
<p>
  Any Carja devout knows that the truth of the Old Ones is laid out plainly in
  the Articles of the Sun Faith. A twilight time came upon them, as is the
  cycle of things, followed by a long night, and finally our ancestors' birth
  in the new dawn. Since that dawn, Carja history has been writ in the path of
  the Sun, not the faded glories of those who came so long before us (even the
  Leaves of the Old Ones found by Araman are long since cracked and fallen to
  dust.)
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, collected here for study are the colorful beliefs of the Old
  Ones held by other tribes, which may offer a small insight into those
  tribes' primitive views of the world.
</p>
<p>
  The Osser am, as might be expected, view the workings of the world as a device,
  one where all things behave according to mechanical rigidity and not the
  Sun's divine rhythms. The movement of the tribes, of the seasons, even the
  stars at night, all are accounted for by this interlocking and complicated
  mechanism. The Old Ones were the caretakers of this great machine, but they
  neglected their duty to maintain it.
</p>
<p>
  The world-machine thus fell into disrepair, and the civilization of the Old
  Ones collapsed with it. Now the Osser am use their myth to berate the other
  tribes as negligent, and to hammer upon their own importance. How convenient
  that their tinkers and metalworkers alone might learn this mechanism's
  secrets, and improve upon it with their ingenuity!
</p>
<p>
  An even more fanciful tale of censure comes from the Nora barbarians. They
  believe that the Old Ones turned away from the teachings of the Nora's
  female god, the All-Mother, and eloped with the machines to build their
  mighty cities. Having failed to tempt the Nora to join them, the machines
  rallied under a great 'Metal Devil' and attacked the All-Mother. In her
  vengeance, she stripped the machines of their wisdom, reducing them to the
  simple metal beasts we see today.
</p>
<p>
  Without the assistance of the machines, the Old Ones were left to wander as
  exiles, never permitted to return to the isolation of the Nora and their
  strange feminine rites. From the survivors of this so-called punishment grew
  the other tribes, and this is why the Nora show distrust to all outside
  their borders: for we are descended from the 'faithless', and do not shun
  the trappings of the ancient world.
</p>
<p>
  Surprisingly, it is the Banook whose belief is most similar to our own,
  though their mythology is bizarre in many other ways. They believe the Old
  Ones grew complacent, thinking there was no challenge they could not
  overcome, and in their pride were undone. Hence the Banook give them no more
  attention than any other tribe defeated by the harshness of Banook land.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, many Banook hunters point to the absence of ruins in Banoor as a
  sign that the Old Ones were never strong enough to endure its challenges.
  They claim that only the machines and the Banook have ever roamed there, and
  so they have nothing to learn from the ancients.
</p>
<p>
  The distant Utaru however, believe that the Old Ones are still with them at
  all times. In Utaru ritual those who die are returned to the
  soil, nourishing the land and living on through new growth. As long as the
  dead are remembered, they will contribute to the harvests and make them
  bountiful. Utaru see the richness of their territory Plainsong as evidence
  of this unique and disturbing cycle.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, as there are few living scholars of the Tenarkth, we are regrettably
  denied any insight from that tribe. From what is known though, it seems
  they have little concept of a wider history at all. But of course, this is
  what elevates a scholar of Meridian from a bloodthristy raider. To be aware
  of all the Sun's light touches, however strange and unlikely the tales.
