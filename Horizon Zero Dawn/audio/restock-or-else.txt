SUBJECT: Restock Or Else...

For the FIFTH time, PLEASE restock the lounge's selection of herbal teas! If I
have to listen to one more egghead throw a tantrum because we're out of the
organic Cucumber Mint or Blackberry-Sage varietals, I am going to lose it!
Please respond - and this time, no "tempest in a teapot" or "steep demand"
jokes, okay?!
