    Okay, I want to get something off my chest right now because this needs to
    be said. To all Jessefans, and to the entire Romantic Fortunes fan
    community: Jessica Sterling 
    <prosody volume='+05dB'>
      should<break time='50ms' />
      not<break time='50ms' />
      win<break time='50ms' /> 
    </prosody>
    Romantic Fortunes!
    This is so obvious to anyone who actually
    <prosody volume='+05dB'>
      pays<break time='50ms' />
      attention.

    I used to be like you guys. Last season, I wanted
    Jessica to win! But as of episode three oh one, she has gone 
    <prosody volume='+05dB'>too far!</prosody>
    Were you people
    even watching when she rejected Luis <prosody volume='+05dB'>
      the sweetest human being<break time='50ms' />
      on<break time='50ms' />
      the<break time='50ms' />
      planet.
    </prosody>
    He stood by her through
    <prosody volume='+05dB'>everything.</prosody>
    The Alaska acquisition? That time the
    harrier-bots malfunctioned mid battle? The only reason Jessica has had
    <prosody volume='+05dB'>any</prosody> success is because Luis had her
    back. He loves her! And she doesn't even care! This is why I am throwing
    my support behind Vernon. I do not take this decision lightly. I was a
    Jessefan for two whole seasons. Jessica is the whole reason I even care
    about Sterling Mal keet. But as a fan, I cannot continue to support someone
    so heartless. <prosody volume='+05dB'>Luis, you<break time='50ms' /> can<break time='50ms' /> do<break time='50ms' /> better!</prosody>
