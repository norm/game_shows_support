Let me begin by spelling out "disaster" for you: a destructive event causing a
level of disturbance unmanageable via the application of ordinary resources.
What you have given us is distinctly ordinary.

Dummies version: Give me what I need, or you'll be on an autocar to Layoff City
quicker than you can say "Code Red."

The list, one more time:

<s>3000 MREs, no lasagna</s>
<s>30 military-grade flashlights, no more junk-store crap</s>
<s>10 portable water pumps, not five, not eight, ten</s>
<s>50 tubes of fungicide, we're working underground, spores happen</s>
<s>15 hydraulic jacks</s>
<s>12 replacement drone propulsion units</s>
<s>50 holographic microdrives, in a disaster, see definition above, it's
absolutely critical to track all ingresses and egresses of the facility</s>
<s>I take our safety seriously, even if yew don't.</s>
<s>50 almond-scented, extra-soft
<prosody volume='x-soft' rate='x-slow' pitch='x-low'>data corrupted</prosody></s>
