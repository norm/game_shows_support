Let me begin by spelling out "disaster" for you: a destructive event causing a
level of disturbance unmanageable via the application of ordinary resources.
What you have given us is distinctly ordinary.

Dummies version: Give me what I need, or you'll be on autocar to Layoff City
quicker than you can say "Code Red."

The list, one more time:

3000 MREs (no lasagna!!!)
30 military-grade flashlights (No more junk-store crap.)
10 portable water pumps (Not five, not eight, TEN.)
15 hydraulic jacks
12 replacement drone propulsion units
50 holographic microdrives (In a disaster -- see definition above -- it's
absolutely critical to track all ingresses and egresses of the facility. I
take our safety seriously, even if you don't.)
50 almond-scented, extra-soft [DATA CORRUPTED]
