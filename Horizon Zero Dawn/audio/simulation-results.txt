SUBJECT, sim you lation Results.

Wow! You weren't kidding about GAIA's predilection for animal morphologies!
Sure, not totally unexpected given the rough natural terrain her bots will
have to navigate, but I agree that there's something deeper going on here. Her
designs aren't just functional. They feel almost like, well, "tributes" is the
word that comes to mind. As though she's already mourning their loss. And not
just for the disappearing fauna of our time, but creatures from the fossil
record too - references to megafauna in some of her designs. So cool!

Well, whatever GAIA thinks up, HEPHAESTUS will empower her to build it. I just
wish we could still be around in a century or two to see what she makes!
