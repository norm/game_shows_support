Tektuk: It is only because you will never read these glyphs that I can write
them. After a lifetime of longing, I spent only a single night with Ili your
mother, a memory that I cherished but she reviled, a burning coal of guilt she
carried in her belly. And so I wonder: Was her guilt laid bare the night
Signak our chieftain was killed. Did he discover the truth. Was she forced to
defend herself. If only I had been there, to stand between them, to actually
strike the blow I was punished for. At least then I would have been her
champion, and the father you deserved, for a single moment. I paint this mark
with eternal regret, and leave you this offering, though it will never touch
the warmth of your hands.
