TO: Elisabet Sobeck
SUBJECT: Encapsulated DNA

And the winner is: Encapsulated DNA.

Over the past 10 days I performed an exhaustive review of data storage
solutions. Magnetic. Optical. Quantum. Even that Eternity tech that FAS was
shilling a year or so ago. But every other solution has one or more fatal
shortcomings: too heavy to transport, too massive to install in the allotted
space, too power-intensive over the centuries, too prone to failure past
300-400 years, et cetera.

Encapsulated DNA will easily hold the 40+ zettabytes we're projecting for
APOLLO. There are still many details to finalize, or course. To start with, we
need to select the inert material in which we'll embed the molecules (already
testing 16 candidate materials), as well as design and fabricate the power
systems and sealed reliquaries that will keep the DNA at -18 degrees C for
1000+ years.

So long as I assure you that it didn't factor in to my decision, may I confess
that I deem it entirely fitting - indeed, propitious - that we will be using
the very building blocks of life to preserve human knowledge from mechanized
extinction? It's not just ironic, but heroic - Life as the hero, beating back
the forces of oblivion.

In any case - much to do. Until next time -

Peace be with you,
Samina
