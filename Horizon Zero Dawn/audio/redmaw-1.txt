The Record of Redmaw by Inquiring Jandiniman,
Historian-In-Residence at the Hunters Lodge
</p>
<p>
It is well known that facts recede into fictions as they become memories, and
fresh facts themselves are ephemeral among the rumors and legends of the
south. This is especially true in the case of Redmaw, the most terrible of
Thunderjaws, a machine which is nothing if not legendary. Few who have laid
eyes upon it have survived, and among them even fewer can be trusted not to
embellish their tales. All that said, here I have endeavored to truthfully
chronicle all the calamities attributed to the beast, and all the expeditions
meant to end such calamities once and for all. None have succeeded. As of this
writing, the terror of the south still roams free, scarred perhaps, but deadly
as the day the sun first shone upon its armored hide.
</p>
<p>
In the early spring of the eighteenth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
a freehold was destroyed near the Hands of the Flood. Nine bodies were
recovered (eight riddled with cannon rounds, one flattened completely). No
witnesses survived. Though never proven, this is widely thought to be Redmaw's
first attack.
</p>
<p>
In the late spring of the eighteenth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
an expedition of four hunters set out from Sunstone Rock to track the machine
or machines responsible for the destruction of the freehold. None returned.
Their bodies were subsequently found in the south (three blasted, one
stomped). Never proven, but thought to be Redmaw's work.
</p>
<p>
In the early summer of the eighteenth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
an expedition of six mercenaries set out from Meridian to track the machine or
machines responsible for the losses described above. One returned (ribs
crushed, clavicle fractured). He spoke of a Thunderjaw which split a man in
half with a single bite. This is the first confirmed sighting of the legendary
machine, and the one which gave it a name.
</p>
<p>
In the late summer of the eighteenth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
an expedition of eight set off from Meridian to track Redmaw. None returned.
Six bodies were found near Blackwing Snag (one blasted, three stomped, two
eviscerated, one swallowed his own tongue evidently in a spasm of terror,
suffocating).
</p>
<p>
In the autumn of the eighteenth year of his reign, the Sun-King Jerahn
commanded the Hunters Lodge to send an expedition south in pursuit of Redmaw.
After numerous logistical delays, three Hawks and their Thrushes set out in
winter. Only one pair returned, reporting the deaths of the others (two
blasted, one stomped, one decapitated). The survivors were sacrificed for
cowardice (one gutted by a Sawtooth, the other skewered by Kestrels). After
this setback, members of the Lodge grew wary of pursuing the legendary
Thunderjaw; only the proudest Hawks even considered it. Aspir ants to the
Lodge, however, foolish in their ambition, eagerly took part in subsequent
hunts.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of the nineteenth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn, the
destruction of a caravan south of the Spurflints (three blasted, two stomped,
one immolated) reignited interest in Redmaw. Three expeditions totaling
fifteen mercenaries went after the machine, with only three survivors (nine
blasted, three stomped, two eviscerated, one liquefied).
</p>
<p>
In the early spring of the twentieth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
a cohort of twelve soldiers headed from the Raingathers to the Alight were set
upon by the beast. Only one survived (one blasted, one stomped, ten crushed
when their fleeing footsteps triggered an avalanche).
</p>
<p>
In the late spring of the twentieth year of the reign of the Sun-King Jerahn,
three cohorts totaling thirty-four men went in search of Redmaw. Alas, they
were ambushed by Stalkers and only four survived (twenty-four sniped, six
exploded). Understandably, this ended pursuit of Redmaw for some time.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of the first year of the reign of the Sun-King Avad, a group of
six Osser am traders were attacked by the beast (one blasted, three stomped, one
spit into a ravine). The lone survivor petitioned Captain Ersa to send the
Vanguard after the monster, but the request was denied. However, three
additional expeditions, comprised of mercenaries and hunters aspiring to the
Lodge, were subsequently commissioned:
</p>
<p>
Autumn, seven men (two blasted, three stomped, one tripped on his own spear).
One survivor.
</p>
<p>
Winter, nine men (three blasted, two stomped, two died from frostbite). Two
survivors.
</p>
<p>
Spring, eleven men (five blasted, one stomped, three "retreated" off a cliff).
Two survivors.
</p>
<p>
The last known sighting of Redmaw occurred in the spring of the third year of
the reign of the Sun-King Avad. Tarkas, Hawk of the Lodge, got word of a
sighting near Thunderhead and set off to take the beast on his own. His
Thrush, Tal aah nah, arrived at the scene too late, just as Tarkas was dying of
his wounds (multiple perforations). Tal aah nah testified that as Redmaw lumbered
off through the trees, she could see the spear of her mentor embedded in its
hide.
