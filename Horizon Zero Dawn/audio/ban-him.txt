Subject: Ban him!!!

Kenny,

I get it, okay? I really do. Faro is Firebreak's patron, Blevins is Faro's
lapdog, circle of ass-kissing, blah blah blah. But if you allow Blevins to
remain on site, installation is going to take twice as long as we're budgeted
for. And I don't know how deep Firebreak's pockets are, but I can guarantee
you they're not bottomless.

We've just got done recalibrating the entire fleet! The entire fleet, Kenny!
Why, I imagine you're wondering? Oh, Kenny. I'm so glad you hypothetically
asked. Blevins was unhappy with the baseline behavioral routines of the
security drones (you know, the ones he selected himself?). Not aggressive
enough, he said. I doubt a Rottweiler mounted on an ICBM would be aggressive
enough for him.

So we patched in some combat behaviors (which, let me tell you, was not easy),
basically outfitted these things for war. Think about that, Kenny.
Bleeding-edge combat drone patrolling an empty wilderness. All so Blevins can
play army on Firebreak's dime.

I'm begging you, Kenny. Find a way to ban him from the hangar. Please.

-Harris.
