PERSONAL LOG:

Oh-point-six. What does it meant to quantify an intelligence, anyway? You
can’t just assign a number on a continuum to a conscious mind and then expect
it to obey whatever arbitrary limit that number represents.

There’s no way around it. Without the supervision of a mind beyond human
capacities, Firebreak is going to fail. And oh-point-six won’t cut it, either.
By pushing sentience, you inevitably generate a system that can experience
emotion. Wild, sloppy, unmanageable emotion. You’re capable of abstract
thought, you’re capable of fear. Like Vast Silver.

I won’t go through that again. I categorically refuse.

Hopefully I can get this all across to Kenny. I like him. I like his lopsided
little smile. I especially like those circles he makes with his hands when he
gets excited about an idea. If we hadn’t been flung together like this, maybe
he and I… Well, no point in woolgathering.

I wonder, could an artificial brain experience this singular combination of
desire and preemptive regret?
