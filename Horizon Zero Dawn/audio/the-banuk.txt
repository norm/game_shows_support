  A Guide to Banoor and the Banook by the Well-Traveled Aram
</p>
<p>
  Ah, the Sun shines golden on these times, where one can experience the whole
  world without leaving the streets of Meridian, for the gates are thrown
  open, and the world comes to us! And yet, as I walked among the markets, I
  heard a question on the air again. What to make of the Banook, these stoic,
  silent northern hunters? These men and women of the ice?
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately for my investigations, Banook outlanders seldom remain in
  Meridian long enough for exhaustive study, it is believed their cold blood
  does not take well to the heat. If I was to seek this knowledge, I would
  have to undergo the ordeal of taking up travel pack and quill, and
  journeying to their homeland. And so it came to be that I spent a miserable
  time living among the Banook in frigid Banoor.
</p>
<p>
  Though the Banook speak of their territory in reverent tones, put plainly it
  is the most uncomfortable place in the world. There is beauty, soaring
  glaciers of jeweled hues, billows of steam that erupt from the earth,
  whirling auroras in the skies above, yes yes, but the novelty quickly
  passes and the bone-freezing chill remains. It is a country of the Moon, for
  in the day the Sun is reduced to a needle's eye through the grey, and in the
  night, the Moon rises four times the width.
</p>
<p>
  There is no welcome, not in the land nor from its people. Though I lived
  among one of the 'wearacks', something like a group of families but without
  the civility of a noble house, each member must prove that they possess the
  will to survive alone. They seek to always be challenged, whether at the
  jaws of a machine or simply in their daily existence. I tried to explain my
  position: that a Carja faces a challenge, devises a solution, and then with
  the challenge overcome can live in contentment.
</p>
<p>
  This concept horrified them. It was made clear that when I expected to
  sleep, I must dig out my own hollow in the snow for my tent; when I expected
  to eat, I must hunt food myself. I hid my disappointment, after all I had
  participated in a Hunting Trial or two in my time, and accepted. On the
  third morning I was able to bring down a rabbit much like those seen in the
  plains, but with a downy snow-coat.
</p>
<p>
  Upon presenting my prize to the wearack, I received only blank stares, until
  one indicated I must skin and prepare it. Reader, I will spare you the
  details. The experience nearly changed me to eat only maize-bread forever
  more.
</p>
<p>
  I had barely finished my gory portion before the Banook set off on a machine
  hunt with their shahman, a man with machine bindings sown into his very skin.
  (Perhaps another challenge, to decency.) He claimed to sense the machine
  spirits close by, and sure enough the hunters and I followed tracks in the
  snow to a Grazer herd. The Banook made short work of them with their spears,
  and struck with a curious desire to prove myself, I threw myself into
  stripping a fallen machine for parts.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of praise for my initiative, I was subjected to the shahman's cursing
  and wailing, and hauled back to camp by a sullen hunter. Eventually, she
  explained that the machine spirits must be thanked for the gift of a
  successful hunt before any parts are harvested. Truly, I was despairing of
  the shifting wiles of Banook culture, and longed for the certainty of the
  Sun's guidance!
</p>
<p>
  That night, mercifully my last, my companions and another wearack gathered
  under a pitiless clear sky to exchange songs, their way of recording
  history. Some understand the glyphs, but choose not to use them, asking
  "What is a song without voices?" (By this point I knew better than to
  answer.) My deeds warranted a whole verse in the song of my companions, but
  from what I could make out, much was lost in the translation. Still, there
  was laughter enough, and many promised to leave me a Banook farewell mark for
  our time together.
</p>
<p>
  I parted ways with the wearack not far from the High Bloom, and set about
  climbing back down to Dawn's Sentinel, and with it Sun-blessed civilization.
  As for the farewell marks, I saw no such thing when I packed my wetly frozen
  belongings. Another Banook mystery perhaps, and my advice to you dear
  reader, is to let these people keep their mysteries to themselves.
