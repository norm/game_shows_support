I saw a mountain... its haughty peak
and bunched spine vying with the worlds on high,
Deflecting every salvo of the wind,
and shouldering the starlight from the sky,
Brooding above the dunes like some great thinker
considering days to come, as nights go by,
With black clouds wrapped about it for a turban,
and bangs of redhead lightning in its face.
And through the night, that tongueless mountain
uttered marvelous things...
