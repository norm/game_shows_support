TO: Elisabet Sobeck
SUBJECT: Cradle Sealed

ELEUTHIA-01 was successfully sealed before the swarm advancing across Xinjiang
province could detect it. Pingback from crucial systems is good. For our
maiden voyage, a success.

Regards my disputes with the Betas over zygote selection. Of course I
understand we have limited overhead to run simulations of gene flow in our
future humans. But we can all agree there is margin for refinement in future
Cradle populations.

Donc: In addition to personally overseeing completion of the ELEUTHIA-02 site
inside Mt. Namuli, I will formulate and propose a modified zygote selection
plan within the week.
