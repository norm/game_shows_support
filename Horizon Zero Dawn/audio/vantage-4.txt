Looking back, it's almost comical how much I detested Wyatt. I hated
everything about him: his lumpy face, his bad skin, his always-calm voice, his
out-of-style suits, and especially his stupid cowboy name. (I don't care how
badly you want to assimilate, there is never any excuse for naming your kid
after a gunfighter.)

I couldn't believe you would replace my baba - a decorated combat flier - with
a corporate drone. So I made it as hard for you as I could. I was beyond
cruel. I accused to your face of only being interested in Wyatt for his money.
Called you, my own mother, a gold-digger and worse. Refused to attend the
wedding, then got myself arrested the night before just to cinch the point.

It took me years to understand the obvious.

Of course you married him for his money - for my sake, not yours.

Before Wyatt, the job you were working didn't even cover food and rent. When
you didn't get overtime, we slipped deeper in debt or went hungry. You
literally couldn't afford to spend time at home, let alone pay for childcare
or rent a nanny-bot. Meanwhile your son was out of control, a truant and a
thief, not even out of junior high and already a drug addict.

If you'd only had yourself to worry about. I think you would've politely
refused Wyatt's interest. You were no stranger to hardship. Compared to what
you went through getting out of Kolkata in 2037, simple poverty probably seemed
like a cake walk. You knew how to survive.

But your son didn't. I was headed nowhere - at ramming speed.

You married Wyatt to save me. For the stability and opportunities his money
could provide.

It wound up working, but not as smoothly as you hoped. Before I could be
saved, I had to die first.

But that's a story for the Amphitheater.
