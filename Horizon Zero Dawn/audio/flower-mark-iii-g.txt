    Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
    One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
    When he called the flowers so blue and golden,
    Stars that in earth's firmament do shine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stars they are, wherein we read our history,
    As astrologers and seers of eld;
    Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery,
    Like the burning stars which they beheld.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wondrous truths and manifold as wondrous,
    God hath written in those stars above;
    But not less in the bright flowerets under us
    Stands the revelation of his love.
