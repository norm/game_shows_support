To All Staff,

I regret to inform you that our worst fears have been realized. The Wichita
salient has collapsed, and our position will be overrun in less than
twenty-four hours.

As I'm sure you understand, exfiltration transport is not available. If you
wish to abandon the facility and try your luck on foot, you may do so. Lock 2
will unseal at 2100 hours and remain unsealed for 15 minutes. Godspeed.

For those who'd rather not die on our feet, there will be a gathering in the
community room at 2200 hours, and Nurse Chana will make other means available.

I want to underscore how proud I am of each and every person who served at
this post. It is important to bear in mind that our sacrifices were not in
vain. I hope that makes this a little easier.

For months now I've been signing off messages as "Director Evans", but I
suppose we can dispense with such formalities now.

Respectfully,

Ellen
