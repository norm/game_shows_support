An association of individuals, created under authority of law, having
existence powers and liabilities distinct from those of its members. In a
business sense, a corporation is usually owned by shareholders, through the
sale or distribution of stock, who profit from such ownership, vote at
designated times for its governance, and designate executives who run its
affairs. Most corporations engage in one or more industries to produce goods
or offer services for profit, and may in turn own other corporations
companies or property as holdings.
