  A Guide to The Claim by the Well-Traveled Aram
</p>
<p>
  Often, I fling open the windows of my villa not only to partake of the
  scents and sights of the city, but to hear the questions on the streets.
  Equally often, I hear asked aloud: what to make of these outsiders, these
  Osser am, who are suddenly our allies or even neighbors? Why do they eat as
  they do, argue as they do? What is the matter of their heady scent? Why are
  they always drinking?
</p>
<p>
  Like a ray of the Sun amid the darkness, a
  question is best followed to its source. So, for the benefit of the
  inquisitive, I contrived to join a trading caravan to the Claim, at least as
  far as the closest village beyond the Breakwalls.
</p>
<p>
  The Claim. It is a muted land, where fire-smoke hangs heavy in the air among
  the tall thin trees. Where the ground has not been dug up in the Osser am's
  ceaseless search for metal, it is cased in frost, and beneath the frost, yet
  more frost, before stony soil. And worse, soot. Everywhere, soot,
  all-pervading. Though I had worn my sturdiest travel silks, keeping them
  unsoiled proved impossible. Noticing my discomfort, some Osser am washer-women
  offered their services, but seeing the shade of the water in their tubs I
  declined.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, regard for cleanliness is not an Osser am virtue. Despite its
  protective walls of piled slate and slouched round stone huts, the village
  struck me as overly exposed to the elements — the chief elements in the
  Claim being a cold, oily rain, and hoarfrost. Even so, the open fires hissed
  and spat and burned on, and the mood was bustling and lively... much as you
  might find in an outbuilding for livestock, for example. (What I will endure
  to bring the light of knowledge to the folk of my tribe.)
</p>
<p>
  The Osser am have no priests or kings, and spit at the mention of such titles,
  but they defer to the counsel of their wise men, the village 'ealdormen'. It
  seems each settlement elects such men for the purpose of unceasing argument.
  From dawn until long into the night, they shout over each other on matters of
  policy and taxation. Come the next morning, a line of villagers will already
  have formed for the privilege of arguing back.
</p>
<p>
  I joined such a line for several hours while children squealed, birds squawked
  and hammering — accursed, endless hammering — echoed over the trampled straw
  and rain-filled cart ruts. Finally, I was permitted to face the three
  ealdormen and deliver my question. I asked for their opinion on the peace
  between our tribes, and Sun-King Avad's offer of welcome in Meridian itself.
</p>
<p>
  Readers, I say asked, but the matter was not so simple, as the Osser am erupted
  into insults and arguments even before the words had finished leaving my lips.
  I found myself talked over, shouted down, subjected to seemingly unconnected
  abuse, and it was only when I raised my voice in return — an invigorating
  experience — that I was grudgingly answered.
</p>
<p>
  Their opinions are muddled and mixed to say the least, and I will not profane
  this parchment by transcribing the words used to express them. Suffice it to
  say that they see the benefit of free trade between our tribes, and indeed
  have flourished from it, after long years of war. However, it seems few Osser am
  that trade outside the Claim return their taxes, or even return at all — the
  ealdormen believe they are stolen away by a manner of living that is
  "downright Carja." A phrase they punctuate by spitting on the floor.
</p>
<p>
  In return, I suggested that their mistrust and fear of a civilized way of life
  was positively Osser am (I could not bring myself to spit indoors.) This caused
  great commotion, after which I was bodily carried from the building upon the
  shoulders of my hosts, and deposited in the midst of a coming-of-age
  celebration — not for a man, but for some new manner of device.
</p>
<p>
  I awoke on a cart arriving at Pitchcliff. My throat was hoarse, my arms numbed
  from accepting countless challenges to wrestle, and the taste of an alcohol
  much like machine oil was still on my tongue. My head ached as if split down
  the center. Truly, I had risked my life in search of an answer: is there more
  to the Osser am character than brawling drinking and shouting?
</p>
<p>
  Simply put dear reader, there is not — but let us hope that the ealdormen's
  fears will be proven true, and in time the Sun's light and Meridian's glory
  can temper these rough-hewn folk.
