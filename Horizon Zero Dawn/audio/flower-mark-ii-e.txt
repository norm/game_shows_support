Even this morning, O Swan, awake,
arise, follow me!
There is a land where no doubt nor
sorrow have rule: where the terror
of Death is no more.

There the woods of spring are a-bloom,
and the fragrant scent "He is I",
is borne on the wind:
There the bee of the heart is deeply
immersed, and desires no other joy.
