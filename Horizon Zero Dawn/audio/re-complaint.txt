<p>From Jay Friedkin, To Reception, Subject, Re: Complaint</p>
<p>
Hey Reception, if that is your real name. Wanna know who scheduled Indo-Malay
right next to FreshGrounds? That would be me, Senior VP of Sales. Wanna know
why? After that little hair-pulling incident, both sides increased their bids
by 40%.
</p><p>
I'll explain, because your receptionist-level brain probably requires it.
Those two sides are <emphasis>FIGHTING</emphasis>. And what do we sell? That's
right, <emphasis>COMBAT MACHINES</emphasis>. We <emphasis>WANT</emphasis> them
to hate each other. So they will try to fight each other with, what? That's
right again, <emphasis>COMBAT MACHINES</emphasis>. Which they will pay us a
lot of money for.
</p><p>
So I suggest you go back to serving coffee with a blank smile, and let me do
my much-more-complicated job.

Thanks a bunch,
Mr. Friedkin to you
