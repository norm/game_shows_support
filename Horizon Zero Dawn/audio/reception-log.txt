Field Commandant Daing of the Indo-Malay Agricultural Com bine arrived with his
delegation. Refreshments to be served before their 10:15 AM sales presentation

<p>10:07 AM</p>

Sander Agnew, Vice President of Territorial Integrity from FreshGrounds Coffee
Global arrived with his entourage. Refreshments to be served before their
10:30 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per instructions, will use
FreshGrounds "Tacoma" blend, no artificial creamers.

<p>10:12 AM</p>

Uh...so that happened. Called security. And janitorial to clean up the coffee
that was spilled. Actually, more like thrown. I wasn't aware that the
Indo-Malay Com bine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds' "acquisition
team" has tried to take their fields by force, repeatedly. I think Commandant
Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who schedules these things?
I'm going to drop a line to Sales. This can't happen again.
