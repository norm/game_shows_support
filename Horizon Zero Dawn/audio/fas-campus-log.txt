Automated log note: Full lockdown has been initiated.

<s>HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:</s>
Due to the increasing frequency of violent protests targeting the campus, the
security of FAZ employees can no longer be guaranteed. Therefore, we have
taken the difficult decision to shutter this facility indefinitely. Staff will
be briefed on a block-by-block basis regarding proper procedure for archiving
and/or disposal of project-related data and materials. Hi-Sec and a crisis
team will then conduct exit review before <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> areas are
locked down.

Priority messaging to all staff in E and F blocks: treat the current lockdown
situation as an exercise but <emphasis>DO NOT</emphasis> attempt to release
the hatches or otherwise exit the buildings.
</p><p>
<s>HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:</s>
A reminder that while Hi-Sec personnel remain committed to employee safety
during the current unfortunate events, personal firearms
<emphasis>MUST</emphasis> be relinquished when presenting for Identiscan.

<s>HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:</s>
Additional public access roads en root to the campus have now been closed to
relieve waiting time at the outer security cordons. Hi-Sec reminds all staff
that the campus remains off-limits to the public.

Following recent campus security issues, all staff are reminded that
presenting for Identiscan and displaying your security badge prominently at
all times for image analytics are both <emphasis>MANDATORY</emphasis>.

In light of recent acts of terrorism directed at the rapid transit system,
Hi-Sec now offers a 'big brother' initiative to accompany staff traveling from
off-site. Signup is required and strongly encouraged.
