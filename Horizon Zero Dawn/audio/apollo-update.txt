FROM: Samina Ebadji
TO: Elisabet Sobeck
SUBJECT: APOLLO Update

Over the past two months, the full benefit of our procurement of a copy of the
HOMER archive from Far Zenith has made itself known, and as a result, all of
APOLLO's key deliverables are on schedule.

APOLLO has already surpassed 40 million discrete data entries and continues to
grow. The physical science modules are effectively "complete" with soft
science modules close behind; world history, cultural data, and media archives
are also on schedule. Language preservation is wrapping up (a bit ahead of
schedule, due to falling short of our goal to preserve 4500 languages; I
suppose the tragic early loss of Papua New Guinea doomed that goal from the
outset), with attendant curricula development about to begin.

Speaking of the heuristic curricula - they are performing well in testing,
with children and adolescents demonstrating high levels of engagement with and
trust in the Aristotle and Aspasia personae. Personally, I find them highly
engaging - especially when they debate. I wish half my professors had been so
entertaining.

Peace be with you,
Samina.
