JOSHUA: “The Return of the Director Emeritus.” Decent holo title.

GINA: No, BAD title – and worse subject. The camera crew would die of boredom.

Whatever Gina. It’s still the most excitement this hell-cave’s seen in a long time.

Your standards for “exciting" are depressingly low.

I’ll squeeze what ICANN out of this thanks.

You always were a little sweet on Kenny.

What? No way. His ears are enormous. Besides, he was too busy mooning over Anita.

I want to know what he’s doing here in the first place. It’s not normal.

He helped engineer the most advanced geothermal facility in history, then rode off into the sunset. Now he wants to check up on his masterwork. Seems normal to me.

But why now? He keeps poking around in the cooling facility and asking questions about CYAN. Do you think there’s something wrong?

Last I checked, there’s been no deviation in any of our readings since the most recent microquake swarm. Maybe Kenny likes taking field trips on Faro’s dime.

It’s been fourteen years! They would’ve frozen those accounts by now.

Has it been that long? Man, I’m old.

Not old. Just boring.
