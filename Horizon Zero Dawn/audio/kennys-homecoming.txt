JOSHUA: “The Return of the Director Emeritus.” Decent holo title.

GINA: No, BAD title – and worse subject. The camera crew would die of boredom.

JOSHUA: Whatever, Gina. It’s still the most excitement this hell-cave’s seen in a long time.

GINA: Your standards for “excitement” are depressingly low.

JOSHUA: I’ll squeeze what I can out of this, thanks.

GINA: You always were a little sweet on Kenny.

JOSHUA: What? No way. His ears are enormous. Besides, he was too busy mooning over Anita.

GINA: I want to know what he’s doing here in the first place. It’s not normal.

JOSHUA: He helped engineer the most advanced geothermal facility in history, then rode off into the sunset. Now he wants to check up on his masterwork. Seems normal to me.

GINA: But why now? He keeps poking around in the cooling facility and asking questions about CYAN. Do you think there’s something wrong?

JOSHUA: Last I checked, there’s been no deviation in any of our readings since the most recent microquake swarm. Maybe Kenny likes taking field trips on Faro’s dime.

GINA: It’s been fourteen years! They would’ve frozen those accounts by now.

JOSHUA: Has it been that long? Man, I’m old.

GINA: Not old. Just boring.
