Bob,

Another problem to add to our big steaming pile. Apparently a fisherman in the
Banda Sea captured video of a Hartz-Timor Horus unit refueling via biomatter
conversion along the shoreline of Pulau Wetar. On a pod of endangered
dolphins no less, quite possibly the last of their kind. Not to get graphic,
but it looks like what happens inside a blender, as if the robot was whipping
up a big pink swirling milkshake of dolphin chum. Our suppression team has
scrubbed it from 43 networks, but it's still propagating, so it's only a
matter of time before it goes viral. A prepared statement feels grossly
insufficient. Any suggestions? This one's a real stinker.
