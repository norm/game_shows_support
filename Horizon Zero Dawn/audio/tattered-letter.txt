Dearest Cogs and Puppets,

You miserable bungs have failed to find me. Again. Your attempts to capture me
would make me laugh if I weren't so busy running circles around you and your
so-called "intelligence" gathering. Just give up. Or better yet, kill
yourselves and save me the effort you worthless slags.

Never yours,
Dervahl.
