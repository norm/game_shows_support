Okay. I admit it. I watched the holo of the toast six straight times, taking
in every detail. Anita’s smile, the way she giggled at her own jokes, my
clumsy handoff to CYAN. Every time it played, for a second I felt like I was
there again, with her, among friends, savoring our success.

With diminishing returns of course. By the sixth time I was just staring at
Anita, and feeling really creepy about it.

But I can be forgiven can’t I? It was the best night of my life.

Besides, I’m entitled to a little nostalgia. We saved the world from fire and
death. Or at least suffocation by ash. So there’s that, right?
