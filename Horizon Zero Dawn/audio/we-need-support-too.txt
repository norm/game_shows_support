FROM Reception Staff,
TO Admin,
SUBJECT, We Need Support Too!

Reception staff continues to require additional support managing Zed Dee candidates
when they arrive at the facility. Many are frightened or confused. Some are
highly agitated. These are not the sort of persons who are accustomed to
having information withheld from them. At minimum, we need HUMAN translators
(the lang-bots are NOT sufficient) and mild sedatives for the extreme cases.
Any and all support would be welcome! Perhaps you could start by responding to
one of these mails?
