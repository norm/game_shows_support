FROM Travis Tate,
TO Elisabet Sobeck,
SUBJECT "Noise Complaints".

Color me confounded Lizzy. Bashcore? Anyone who says the ol' TT codes to
bashcore is straight-up lyin', and you know it! Ol' Trav don't have no truck
with commercialized razzle-dazz, nuh uh! Heck, I'd rather guzzle a liter of
Citarum runoff than listen to Grey Swarm for thirty seconds! Hand to God and
swear on my momma's grave - and she was religious!

Nah, that ain't bashcore blastin the HADES lab, shaking the walls, rattling
folks' teeth... it's DEATH METAL girl! Classical music! 80s and 90s mostly.
Got me some dutch deathcore, some japanese goregrind, some swedish
cannibal-themed stuff too. Stop by if you want a listen. Or heck, just come
within 50 meters of the lab. Ain't no bashcore you'll see. Or HEAR rather,
in the screech that rends the air! And FEEL - in the throbbing pulse of the
floor and walls and ceiling swallowing you up like you was Jonah trapped in
the gullet of gothic deathfish! Hellalujah!

As for those requests to "turn it down"? No can do Lizzy. <emphasis>THIS IS HOW I CODE!</emphasis>
Turn down my death metal? Might as well give up stimulants, chocolate malts,
and industrial accident vids! Last I heard, we was supposed to be coding HADES
down here. Am I REALLY supposed to code an extinction protocol WITHOUT DEATH
METAL to inspire me? Nah nah I don't think so.

Stay cool,
Trav
