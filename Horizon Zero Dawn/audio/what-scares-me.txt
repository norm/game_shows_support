<s>From Izzy Mandel, to Murk Oslo, Subject</s><s>What scares me</s>

Murk,

Remember what I told you in my last message? About how scared I am? Well, I
figured out what scares me and it's not the bots. I mean yeah, they're
horrifying, but when we finally come face to face, I'll either live or die,
and the starkness and simplicity of that binary is... well, reassuring.

What scares me is how much I like this. How a DEW feels in my hands. The kick
of a coilgun. Jesus Murk, we lived in a squat for three years! Matching
mohawks! Spent our days throbbing off Razorwing or Duster, nights thrashing
off slamfunk gigs! We were goddamn anarchists! And now this? <emphasis>THIS?</emphasis> Discipline,
jargon, uniforms? And I <emphasis>LIKE</emphasis> it???

That's what terrifies me Murk. No crisp reassuring binary here. I'm loving
what I hate... or hated. So does that mean my entire life was just a pose...
or that the person I was, is already dead?

I don't know... I try to tell myself it's a different kind of war. Survival
not profits. I try to tell myself it's just a different kind of direct action.
I mean - what are the bots if not the ultimate capitalist stooges, right? But
thinking just tires me out. All I know is we've got to fight until Zero Dawn
is ready. If I end up surviving this, guess I can worry about my politics
then.

Love to you and little Syd,

Izzy
