FROM Elisabet Sobeck,
TO All Alphas,
SUBJECT, Odyssey Has Failed.

All,

Some terrible news I'm afraid. Far Zenith has informed me that the Odyssey
mission has failed. Last night, telemetry indicated a catastrophic antimatter
containment failure as the drives spun up to depart the solar system. The
ship, its crew, its cargo of zygotes and seeds, its alpha-build of APOLLO.
all were lost.

Zero Dawn is now the only hope for the continuation of the human species and
Earthly life.

We must succeed.

Elisabet
