Margo -

If I doubted your brilliance in the slightest, I wouldn't have picked you as
the HEPHAESTUS Alpha. You need to stop worrying about your age and
communication style. You are who you are. Have confidence in yourself. You
know what you're doing.

Case in point: the latest draft of your plan for the construction and stocking
of bootstrap silos to store raw materials is excellent. This, combined with
your design for the AM foundry core and the foundry site selection plan, add
up to a comprehensive plan. It's time to start construction.

One detail: consult with Ayomide Okilo before you finalize the silo
inventories. HEPHAESTUS's first task will be to fabricate the robots that will
construct the waveform broadcast towers MINERVA will use to transmit the
deactivation codes - so any exotic materials needed for the towers should be
accounted for in the inventory plan.
