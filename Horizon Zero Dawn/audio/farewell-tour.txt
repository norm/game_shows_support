Dear Nobody,
</p><p>
<s>We got in a fight, Laura and I.</s> After practice, we went out for drinks.
There's this Rohbar in downtown Cody, so we called an autocar and shuttled
over. We were the only people there. With the park closing, Cody's becoming a
ghost town.
</p><p>
The more we drank, the more passive-aggressive our banter became, snowballing
out of our control, metastasizing in the empty air between us, and then before
either of us really knew what was happening, we were yelling at each other. I
kept thinking, like, I'm not abandoning her, she's abandoning me. And I guess
she was probably thinking something similar.
</p><p>
We got quiet for a while. Drank more. Eventually Laura ordered an autocar, and
we piled into it, slid as far from each other on the back seat as we could,
arms crossed, staring out the window. And then I heard myself talking. "Screw
it. I don't care if you stay in touch with me. I'm going to stay in touch with
you. Whether you like it or not, you're not getting rid of me. Ever."
</p><p>
Laura looked at me for what felt like ages. I thought she was going to start
yelling. But then her hand crept over mine, and we just sat there together.
</p><p>
Bottoms up,
Shelly
