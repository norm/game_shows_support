1
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:26,648
Ever since the War Party massacre our lands go unpatrolled
and our borders unguarded.

2
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,298
We have no War-Chief to lead us.

3
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,808
Isn't that Resh's job?

4
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:32,902
Ugh.

5
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,801
Before you make the journey to Mother's Crown and beyond.

6
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,249
Is there any chance you could search for Sona?

7
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,249
Where was she last seen?

8
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,468
The War Party massacre site.

9
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:49,199
A wooded hollow across from Devil's Thirst on this side of the river.

10
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,431
You might be able to pick up her trail there.

11
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,277
If she went after the killers who attacked the Proving,

12
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,076
who killed those we love,

13
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:57,576
who tried to kill you…

14
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,238
I get it Varl.

15
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,507
I'll see what I can do.

16
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:10,000
My whole life, all of it in the Embrace.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,552
The world just got bigger.

18
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:14,768
But also more dangerous.

19
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:19,243
[whistle]

20
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:08,108
A Nora village, up on the heights.

21
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,399
The say she fought beside Bast and Vala.

22
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:45,278
Surely you have other things to do beside talk to me?

23
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,109
You're Aloy aren't you?

24
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:52,867
They say you've been made a Seeker
with right of passage from the Sacred Lands.

25
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:56,634
Yes, to track the killers who attacked the Proving.

26
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:59,072
I can't image leaving All-Mother's protection.

27
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,375
But my sister Nakoa is like you.

28
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,375
Fearless.

29
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:07,667
She went north to find a Carja officer called Zaid.

30
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,867
Did the Matriarchs really give Nakoa permission to leave?

31
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,506
No. They refused her.

32
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,175
But nothing could stop her from going after Zaid.

33
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:16,978
He…

34
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,083
For ten years the Carja attacked without warning.

35
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,940
Devils like Zaid butchered Braves
and kidnapped civilians for blood sacrifice.

36
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,155
It all ended when the Mad Sun-King died.

37
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:33,685
The Matriarchs say his son wants to set things right.

38
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:38,874
But that wasn't enough for Nakoa.

39
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:42,129
He murdered our father during the Red Raids.

40
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,432
Nakoa saw it happen.

41
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,082
Hid in the cellar and forced herself to watch.

42
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,400
He changed her.

43
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
You could've gone with her?

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,727
Leave the Sacred Land and be purged from All-Mother's eternal memory? No!

45
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,000
I begged Nakoa to stay so she could avoid that fate.

46
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,982
She said she didn't care.   

47
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:06,711
I don't know.

48
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,005
Will she really be cursed for avenging our father?

49
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:16,213
Seems … cruel.

50
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,667
I'm really worried about her.

51
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,434
I'll keep an eye out for her.

52
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,478
All-Mother bless you!

53
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,281
I know the Matriarchs won't let her return to the Sacred Land, but…

54
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:30,000
I just need to know that she's alright.

55
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,187
She must've passed through Mother's Crown.

56
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:35,702
My aunt Solai lives there. They might've spoken.

57
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,525
Maybe she can tell you more.

58
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:45,155
All-Mother, hear my prayer.

59
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,688
I kneel before you low and humble.

60
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,464
Pleading for strength and understanding.

61
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,464
Can you see beyond your sacred domain?

62
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:13,126
Does your eternal memory encompass the world?

63
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:21,434
If it does, watch over her. Be with her.

64
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,900
That Brave, sounds like he's suffering.

65
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
He was one of the War Party.

66
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,716
Wounded in battle down the ridge there.

67
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,290
He was too weak to be carried back to Mother's Heart.

68
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,500
So they brought him here.

69
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,290
Could you see the ambush from here?

70
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,851
I heard it.

71
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,722
Explosions and screams and … 

72
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:12,538
… howls of machines, like monsters.

73
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:16,192
That's what he keep groaning and muttering about.

74
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,462
Machines like nightmares, ripping everyone to shreds.

75
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,491
I've seen people die before.

76
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,155
But never in such pain.

77
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:28,985
I want to be strong like you, but…

78
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,685
I take it you know who I am?

79
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,304
I do.

80
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,769
I know a lot of people didn't want you in the Proving.

81
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,814
But if you hadn't been there, everyone would've died.

82
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Shows how much we know.

83
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,855
The very person we needed was someone the tribe never wanted.

84
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:52,095
I wish I could borrow some of your courage now. For him.

85
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,095
You don't need to borrow what you already have.

86
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,745
Nothing I do comforts him.

87
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,697
I don't even have any Dreamwillow to ease his pain.

88
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:03,341
There should be some in stashes along Brave Trails to the east, but…

89
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,151
I must keep vigil for this man.

90
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:10,234
I'll check the stashes for Dreamwillow if I get a chance.

91
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,121
You will? Thank you!

92
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,264
My only wish is to ease this poor man's suffering.

93
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,882
This must be where the War Party got massacred.

94
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,609
Such destruction.

95
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,475
Maybe the War-Chief left something behind.

96
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:22,247
Some clue as to where she went.

97
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,418
Lots of machines, all controlled by the killers.

98
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:30,892
They sent a stampede of them down the slope.

99
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,841
The Nora managed to take down a Corruptor.

100
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:43,110
But not before the killers used it to send the other machines against them.

101
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,580
[in the distance]
Brave, let us speak!

102
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,279
Scraps of food.

103
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:08,467
The killers rested here before springing the trap.

104
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,430
Lunch before a bloodbath.

105
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,095
Monsters.

106
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:29,148
You there!

107
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,203
The dead and wounded all cleared away.

108
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,755
Are there no more Braves or Healers here?

109
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,510
Just me.

110
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,737
You're hurt, what happened?

111
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,845
What didn't? It's madness out there.

112
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,934
War-Chief Sona sent me back to report.

113
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,764
I'm no good to her like this.

114
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,059
Varl told me that the War-Chief tracked the killers.

115
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,834
Did she find them?

116
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:05,009
We followed their trail but again and again
 they sent corrupted machines to attack us.

117
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,424
My wounds started to slow me down.

118
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:12,421
So the War-Chief sent me back
to let others know she hasn't given up the fight.

119
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,917
So, you were here when the War Party was ambushed?

120
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:16,818
I was.

121
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,919
I thought after the Proving there could be no darker day.

122
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,622
But I was wrong.

123
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:24,566
The War-Chief was delayed gathering the rear guard.

124
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:28,257
Eager for revenge the Braves in the lead fell into the trap. 

125
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,406
Dozens lost in minutes.

126
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:34,859
If Sona hadn't arrived and rallied us
no-one would've survived.

127
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,182
Varl sent me to look for Sona.

128
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,334
Do you know where she is now?

129
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,696
All I can tell you is where we parted.

130
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:45,717
Near the metal tower
south-east of the ruins at Devil's Thirst.

131
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,540
Look to the rise behind it with a lone boulder.

132
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,293
I'll head for the Embrace
and report what I know to Varl and the others.

133
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,198
May All-Mother lend you strength.

134
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,198
You'll need it, going alone.

135
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,853
My Focus is picking up some kind of signal.

136
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:58,853
Maybe I can scan it. 

137
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,027
That signal, where is it coming from?

138
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,238
Those ruins, that must be Devil's Thirst.

139
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,528
A city of the Old Ones.

140
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,760
Of the Metal World.

141
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,868
A Tallneck.

142
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,041
Looks just like Rost described.

143
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,115
The signal must be coming from it's head.

144
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:45,887
I need to get up there.

145
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,215
Oh, come on!

146
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,467
Ha ha!

147
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:27,373
I think I can leap onto the Tallneck from here.

148
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:49,443
Alright, now I just have to reach it's head.

149
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,388
Just give me a moment and I'll be off your back.

150
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:44,525
So the Tallneck remembers everything along it's path,

151
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,828
and sends what it sees to other machines.

152
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,141
[flashback]
All I can tell you is where we parted.

153
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:04,753
[flashback]
Near the metal tower south-east of the ruins of Devil's Thirst.

154
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:08,032
[flashback]
Look to the rise behind it with a lone boulder.

155
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,564
This must be the rise Sona's runner told me about.

156
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,309
Dressings for wounds.

157
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,254
They must've taken a moment to rest.

158
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:38,458
Arrow shards.

159
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:44,111
That old bow has seen a lot of action.

160
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,484
A recent kill, freshly skinned.

161
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,856
The War-Chief stopped here.

162
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:57,338
So where did she go next?

163
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:04,851
Couldn't have been easy going on after the ambush.

164
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:09,028
The runner wasn't the only one who got hurt.

165
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,100
Might be a blood trail I could follow.

166
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,502
I should try my Focus.

167
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:40,346
Tracks.

168
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,173
Boots and blood.

169
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,869
Looks like Sona and her Braves headed for that ridge.

170
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,130
A dead Sawtooth.

171
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,130
Maybe Sona took it out.

172
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,085
She could be close.

173
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,885
You're lucky I happen by.

174
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:16,179
One heartbeat more and that Sawtooth would've torn you apart.

175
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,463
Half a heartbeat more and I would've killed it myself.

176
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:23,096
Er, so you're War-Chief Sona?

177
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:25,100
Varl asked me to find you.

178
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,534
Has he held the gate?

179
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:28,473
He has, bravely.

180
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:31,716
I saw him kill a corrupted machine himself.

181
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:33,234
But he worries for you.

182
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,677
Our tribe needs strength, not sentiment.

183
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:39,668
I've tracked some of the killers who struck the Proving.

184
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:43,200
I crave vengeance, do you?

185
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:45,900
You have no idea.

186
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,997
Show me then. Lend me your strength.

187
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:50,941
Follow.

188
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,301
[Sona]
The killers are just across this ridge.

189
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,316
Digging the cursed earth.

190
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:06,667
The sin of the ancients is buried in that soil.

191
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,364
Corruptor demons.

192
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:09,629
[Aloy]
I know of them.

193
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:11,627
I killed one at Mother's Watch.

194
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,571
[Sona]
A bold claim. I wonder if you'll live up to it.

195
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,877
Hours ago I sent Braves into hiding in the trees below.

196
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:53,935
On my signal they'll attack.

197
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:56,924
The enemy and their demonic machines outnumber us.

198
00:37:56,924 --> 00:38:00,000
But we will have fury on our side.

199
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,577
We could have more than that.

200
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:03,029
Explain?

201
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:06,934
That's blaze. What we use to burn they use to blast.

202
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,909
It's how they dug out this pit.

203
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:11,141
So we put fire to it and then?

204
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:12,361
Boom.

205
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,122
Then let us begin.

206
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,872
Whoa, wait. Let's not rush.

207
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:19,280
Give me some time to make an approach.

208
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,180
If I end up alerting them, open fire.

209
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,600
Alright. Let's see what you can do.

210
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:04,294
[in the distance]
Who's body is that?

211
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,390
[in the distance]
Farewell!

212
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,750
[Cultist]
Show no mercy!

213
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:37,018
[Cultist]
Follow my lead!

214
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:57,107
[Cultist]
Blast!

215
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:06,534
[Cultist]
Finish this!

216
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
[Nora Brave]
Picking my target now!

217
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,184
[Nora Brave]
An easy shot!

218
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,515
This wasn't all the killers.

219
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:22,727
I counted more at the War Party massacre.

220
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:30,867
If I have to chase their filthy shadows
from here to Spear's Reach, I will.

221
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:32,881
You're hurt. Losing blood.

222
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:36,134
My health is not your concern.

223
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:40,000
No-one doubts your determination but you need rest.

224
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,383
She's right War-Chief. Give your wounds time to close.

225
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:44,793
Varl!

226
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:46,547
What are you doing here?

227
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:49,644
I ordered you to hold that gate with your life.

228
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:51,356
And so I did.

229
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,886
Until the runner you sent retruned with news of his encounter with Aloy.

230
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,344
And your location.

231
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:58,402
I left the gate well guarded.

232
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:00,721
My place is here with you.

233
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:02,086
With our vengeance.

234
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:03,711
Am I not owed that?

235
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,988
Maybe I should have a look around.

236
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:09,948
See if I can figure out where the rest of the killers are.

237
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:11,580
Do are you wish.

238
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,656
Everyone else does.

239
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,066
Mother!

240
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:56,546
Commanders.

241
00:45:56,546 --> 00:46:00,651
Over the past month accidental Blaze explosions have a killed a dozen men.

242
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:06,423
Here in the Ring of Metal I've taken the precaution
of placing our entire stockpile in a covered shelter,

243
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:08,871
safe from stray sparks and lightning.

244
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:11,645
And I've posted guards to control access.

245
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:14,313
I urge you to take similar measures.

246
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,085
Or suffer the consequences.

247
00:46:17,085 --> 00:46:20,000
Supply Master Thiran out.

248
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:24,711
A Blaze stockpile inside their base.

249
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:27,565
Sabotage that and we win.

250
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:51,834
I've found something.

251
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:55,479
The rest of the killers are camped inside a "ring of metal".

252
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:57,734
Any idea what that means?

253
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:58,864
Damn them!

254
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:02,610
The Ring of Metal lies in the ruins of Devil's Grief.

255
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,323
That ground is taboo.

256
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:10,000
I will return to the Matriarchs,
beg them to make an exception.

257
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,834
There's no time for that.

258
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:14,404
Blood spilled calls for blood spilled!

259
00:47:14,404 --> 00:47:17,734
If the ground is cursed, then let our vengeance sanctify it.

260
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,500
You blaspheme!

261
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,534
Please, War-Chief. Break the taboo!

262
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:26,060
Devil's Grief is a cursed place.

263
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:30,000
But maybe Aloy's Seeker blessing can protect us.

264
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,038
I'll send scouts ahead.

265
00:47:32,038 --> 00:47:35,135
Our force will assemble at the cliff above Red Echoes.

266
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:37,194
And launch our attack from there.

267
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,570
Sounds like a plan.

268
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,634
See you there.

269
00:47:57,434 --> 00:47:58,348
Aloy…

270
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:00,634
…thank you.

271
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:04,407
You might take that back, when you see what I'm getting us into.

272
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,239
On to Devil's Grief then.

273
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,913
Full already.

274
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:37,695
Handy!

275
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
I can get out of this.

276
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,418
That's it, I'm already gone.

277
00:58:30,476 --> 00:58:31,783
This'll help.

278
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
Safe, for a few minutes anyway.>>>>

279
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,577
There!

280
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:15,491
Gotta keep the upper hand.

281
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:01,704
Uh, right.

282
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:51,377
Now what're we doing?
