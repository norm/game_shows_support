1
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,289
Now, how am I gonna get down from here?

2
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,850
Oh. This should be quite the ride.

3
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,590
Ha, I'd do that again if it weren't so much work to get back up there.

4
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,640
These look like Banuk markings.

5
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,959
Is this the way to their territory?

6
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,949
[Banuk wanderer]
The wilds beyond, they're an unkind land.

7
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,240
Seems you're a long way from … anything.

8
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:39,959
Where does this trail lead?

9
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,334
For me it leads south, away from the Banuk.

10
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:46,789
Past the Grave-Hoard, Banukai watch over me.

11
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,088
This is the quickest way out of The Cut.

12
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,348
Instead of going all the way through Oseram territory.

13
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,819
What sort of place is The Cut?

14
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,750
It's on the edge of everywhere.

15
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,100
The edge of Ban-Ur, the edge of the mountains,
the edge of other tribes territories.

16
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,689
It suffered in the war with the Carja.

17
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,479
But it suffered before that too.

18
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,728
Life there is a test, to survive out on the edge.

19
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,538
Not exactly homey. I can see why you'd want to move on.

20
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:17,810
I was named an envoy to the Carja king's court.

21
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,599
No-one else wanted to do it.

22
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,448
It's not so bad.

23
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,469
I just recount the songs from Ban-Ur, and the Carja draw their funny little glyphs.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,210
I tell them of the machines' growing anger and the Carja king still offers aid,
even though he knows the Banuk will not accept it.

25
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:38,228
What kind of strange machines, and what kind of curse?

26
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:41,840
Smoke comes off the mountain like a funeral pyre all day and night.

27
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,658
Machines tougher and crazier than anything in the South, I heard.

28
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,780
It's enough to make me look forward to Meridian.

29
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,848
Well, thanks for the warning. I'm curious about these machines, though.

30
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,680
And the warning rolled off you.

31
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,349
I understand, you adventurers are all alike.

32
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,849
Good luck!

33
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,659
Steam and smoke, guysers and funeral pyres, you'll see.

34
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,589
[Sylens, through Focus]
What do you doing, Aloy?

35
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,350
[Sylens, through Focus]
This path leads to The Cut.

36
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,149
[Sylens, through Focus]
The Banuk have nothing to offer besides useless mysticism.

37
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,514
[Sylens, through Focus]
The Eclipse won't stand idle while you waste time playing in the snow.

38
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,149
[Sylens, through Focus]
Return to your task.

39
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,763
[Aloy]
I was thinking, Rost used to tell me stories about the Banuk and their Shamans,

40
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,585
[Aloy]
and how they thread blue cables through their skin.

41
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,550
[Aloy]
Kind of like someone else we know, huh?

42
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,119
[Aloy]
So maybe the real reason you want me to stay clear of the Banuk…

43
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,189
[Aloy]
…is to stay clear of your past.

44
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,550
[Sylens, through Focus]
It's the ancient past that concerns me Aloy, not my own.

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,410
[Sylens, through Focus]
Which is why you should stop prattling and get back to what matters.

46
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,477
[Sylens, through Focus]
But as usual, you'll do as you wish.

47
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:48,350
[Aloy]
Mmm, touchy.

48
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,689
This one's a new predator.

49
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,649
Can see the heat coming off it.

50
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:44,323
[horn blares]

51
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,454
[in the distance]
Outlander on the mountain!

52
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,080
[Aloy]
Okay, that's a welcome, I guess.

53
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,009
[Aloy]
All of the winters coming at once.

54
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,546
[Banuk guard]
Ha! You sure you'll be warm enough up here, Nora?

55
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,690
[Aloy]
I've worked up a sweat from the climb.

56
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,679
[Banuk guard]
You made it to The Cut outlander.

57
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,649
[Banuk guard]
Not that you'll stay long.

58
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,556
[Banuk guard]
This is Song's Edge, biggest settlement in The Cut.

59
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,799
[Banuk guard]
These are dangerous lands outlander, deadly even.

60
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:40,649
Smoke rising from the mountain, and the village too.

61
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,659
What's it for?

62
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,149
[Banuk Shaman]
In times like these we must not forget the importance of ceremony.

63
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,419
[Banuk Shaman]
Ourea's been gone a long time, but she will return.

64
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,149
[Banuk Shaman]
We must believe she will return.

65
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,183
[Banuk villager]
I do not think that our hunter's blood is on Aratak's hands.

66
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:21,929
[Banuk villager]
He led them to a great challenge, that is all.

67
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,149
[Banuk Shaman]
Young hunters have learned a lesson from Thunder's Drum.

68
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:31,354
[Banuk Shaman]
Sometimes loss is the price of survival.

69
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,750
[Banuk Shaman]
If you died on Thunder's Drum, your songs will not be forgotten.

70
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,244
[Aloy]
Must be something big going on.

71
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,750
Most of the village is moving towards that smoke.

72
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,960
[Banuk Shaman]
In times like these we must not forget the importance of ceremony.

73
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,375
[Banuk warrior]
So many dead, at least we still have Aratak to guide us.

74
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,467
Get ready for a rare sight, Nora.

75
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,750
Burgrend, purveyor of necessities.

76
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,450
Most of the time the Banuk burn their dead, but not today.

77
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,809
Because the bodies couldn't be recovered.

78
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,779
Aye. A nasty business, all their best warriors lost.

79
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,539
So they're getting a different kind of send-off.

80
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,460
Grasp your grief, my hunters, and kill it!

81
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,022
For our kin seized the fate all Banuk long for.

82
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:59,149
Falling with their spears striking steel.

83
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:03,834
Their struggle is over now.

84
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:11,160
You have witnessed their spirits rise up
into the blue sky and beyond to the blue light.

85
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,089
But our struggle is only beginning.

86
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,589
Soon we will again take up the hunt against
the Daemon that frenzies the machines against us!

87
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,834
And so I ask you, can you summon the courage of our fallen kin?

88
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,554
Will you fight and die as well as they did?

89
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,130
[cheers]

90
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,584
My courage, my spear!

91
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,683
[cheers]

92
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:48,681
Our blood is in your teeth, Aratak!

93
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:55,411
We are Banuk, our enemies are prey.

94
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,746
"The Daemon that frenzies the machines"

95
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:09,048
Machines that wiped out their best.

96
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,549
And what do they want to do?

97
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,259
Go back up there!

98
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,049
Fools.

99
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,569
I've been up here for two long winters and I still can't make sense of the Banuk.

100
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:21,889
Take this ruckus.

101
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,714
It started with one of their Shamans, Ourea.

102
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:30,699
Spouting on about spirits and daemons up on Thunder's Drum.

103
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,839
So they marched their werak up there,
and half of them get slaughtered by machines.

104
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,618
I don't know what Ourea found up there.

105
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,880
A Shaman's not going to talk to an outlander.

106
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,318
The machines in The Cut are getting more vicious, that's a fact.

107
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,399
It could be because of "the Daemon".

108
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,069
Or it could be because they all got indigestion for all I know.

109
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,134
But Ourea's not around to explain, she took off.

110
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,549
I thought the crazy might have gone with her, but no.

111
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,259
Here's big Aratak, gearing them up to do it all over again.

112
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,489
Everything's a test to them.

113
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,389
A hardship to endure, a challenge to survive.

114
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,642
Seems like they don't have much of a choice in a place like this.

115
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:19,739
Yeah, a land cold enough to crack teeth, filled with wild animals.

116
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,509
You think they'd accept a little reasonably priced aid.

117
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,097
Believe me, I've tried to convince them.

118
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:30,049
But a Banuk with nothing left to prove might just lie down and die.

119
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,634
Is Aratak a renowned warrior around here?

120
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:34,108
He's a werak chieftain.

121
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,639
His voice carries a lot of respect.

122
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,108
Not that you hear much of it.

123
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,848
Man talks about as much as a dead fish.

124
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,548
What are these "weraks" about, Burgrend? Some sort of tribe within the tribe?

125
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,118
Not like our clans back home.

126
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,649
You don't get born into these things.

127
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,278
They hold tryouts.

128
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,899
Prove you're best at something and you might get a place.

129
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,583
Some weraks come and go, some last as long as metal.

130
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:07,929
The whole Banuk territory, Ban-Ur, is just a bunch of the biggest, oldest weraks.

131
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm not sure if I'm less confused or more confused.

132
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,770
[laughs]

133
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,963
Here's the sure thing.

134
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,225
Each werak has a chieftain and a Shaman, they make the decisions.

135
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:28,759
All well and good, except the chieftains are hardheaded,
and the Shamans have their heads in the clouds.

136
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,769
You said you've lived out here for two winters?

137
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:38,039
Aye, back home some fur traders told me about this steel-forsaken heap of tents.

138
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,206
Good location, ripe for change.

139
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:47,690
When he and Ourea came to town with their werak it drew
more Banuk to this little burg than I'd ever seen.

140
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,640
Know what else I saw, Aloy?

141
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,160
My own little trade route, stretching all the way back to The Claim.

142
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,801
"A great prophet is coming," they said.

143
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,180
I heard "profit".

144
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,190
Then he goes and leads them off to their death at the claws of angry machines.

145
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,660
If we could get through to enough of them,
we could really put this place on the map.

146
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,630
"We"?

147
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,570
Me and my daugh– uh, my assistant. Varga.

148
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,750
My assistant and my daughter.

149
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,939
We seem to get along better as business partners.

150
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,429
Her mother wanted me to show her a trade.

151
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,859
She started tinkering with weapons.

152
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,890
Say when you need a break from this Banuk carry-on, stop in and see her.

153
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:39,349
You're both … er, um, how do I put it?

154
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,634
Women?

155
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,239
No, no, no, no, no! Independent!

156
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,334
Look for her at Longnotch, the easternmost Banuk camp.

157
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,779
Have you ever heard of a man named Sylens?

158
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:54,439
Tall, deadly serious, cables in his skin like a Shaman?

159
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,432
I've heard that name once or twice, but always whispered.

160
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:02,549
Like some boogeyman the Banuk want to forget.

161
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:07,664
I'm not sure what went down but
I got the impression he messed with the Conclave.

162
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,739
Or they messed with him.

163
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,529
"Conclave"?

164
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,740
All the most important Shamans gather in Ban-Ur from time to time.

165
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,579
To keep up with the latest mumbo-jumbo.

166
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,589
No idea how they all fit into one tent without
those crazy headdresses getting locked up on each other.

167
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,071
Ourea has been to that shindig.

168
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:30,318
But when I asked her what it's like she just gave me a dirty look.

169
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,000
I want to know more about this Daemon.

170
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,900
Uh-uh, it's crazy talk Aloy.

171
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,439
Or there's something to it.

172
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,639
Something connected to how the machines behave.

173
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,049
Then you need to find Ourea.

174
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,019
She was last seen headed for the mountains they call the Icerasps.

175
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,269
I've heard only the Shamans know the trail beyond those frozen peaks.

176
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:55,275
Mmm, but I do know where you could find her apprentice, Naltuk.

177
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,220
He went north of the river, chasing rumours.

178
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,412
Rumours?

179
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,959
Not the good kind.

180
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,038
Sudden attacks in the snow.

181
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,209
Strange new structures.

182
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,629
Some say a new machine like no-one's seen before.

183
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,549
Now I'm definitely interested.

184
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,234
Thanks for the talk, Burgrend.

185
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,409
Don't mention it.

186
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,970
I wonder if Aratak could tell me more about Ourea or Thunder's Drum.

187
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,019
Might be worth a shot.

188
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:27,523
[Banuk warrior]
We've never faced anything like the machines that guard Thunder's Drum.

189
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,549
[Banuk village]
None can remember a time when the Tallneck wasn't trapped in ice.

190
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,538
I do not want to hear this talk from you again.

191
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,649
Doubt is heavier than a week's snow.

192
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,549
Forgive me, my chieftain.

193
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,358
We will be ready for the next attempt.

194
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,450
But this will not be an attempt, it must be done.

195
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:05,600
Do you understand?

196
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
My chieftan.

197
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,349
Good.

198
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,589
Aratak.

199
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,190
Outlander.

200
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,288
I suppose you wish to speak?

201
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,409
You're set on going back to the mountain?

202
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,219
I've put my word to it.

203
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,096
Even with the risks being so great?

204
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,630
The risk of what, death?

205
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:31,880
It would be a worse fate to bow our heads to the challenge and say "too much".

206
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,439
Did your werak come from this place?

207
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,549
No, we rallied most of our hunters from across Ban-Ur
to face the threat of the Daemon.

208
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,660
But I was born here and stayed to fight the Carja
when others retreated into the mountains.

209
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,620
A few of my old warriors remained with me, those who survived.

210
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,109
There are other weraks in Song's Edge too?

211
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:59,039
Yes, the village has its own life for all Banuk who need trade or shelter.

212
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,338
After the war ended, it sprang up from what was once a campsite.

213
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,720
Quick as the bloom between frosts.

214
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,049
Perhaps it will last until the Carja seek war again.

215
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,646
One more thing, Aratak.

216
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:15,730
I wonder, will the mountains answer all your questions?

217
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,588
This Daemon you talked about?

218
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:22,549
If you are hardy enough, you can venture out and see the signs yourself.

219
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,009
It has changed the machines, made them fiercer, stronger.

220
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:29,045
But what is it?

221
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,470
A matter for the Shamans to debate.

222
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,334
Ourea knows about this Daemon, where would I talk to her?

223
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,119
She does a Shaman's work.

224
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,049
That is not for the eyes and ears of others.

225
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,470
Certainly not an outlander's.

226
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,609
Well, I guess that's it, then.

227
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,054
Good, I prefer deeds to words.

228
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,436
Right.

229
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:49,828
To your survival.

230
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,150
[Banuk warrior]
Do we stand around and talk, or do we have responsibilities to attend to?

231
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,217
[Banuk villager]
On top of all we've endured, we find ourselves beset by bandits.

232
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:18,085
[Laulai]
Deep Din, silenced by rising waters.

233
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,549
[Banuk warrior]
Shall we all die beneath the claws of the new machines
just satisfy Aratak's crusade?

234
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:30,990
[Banuk villager]
I don't see what's…

235
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,380
[Banuk villager]
…wrong with the traditional paintings…

236
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:18,099
[Banuk villager]
…Sekuli overcomplicates things.

237
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:31,480
[Laulai]
One day, the stone of the Din was dry, the next, the flood came.

238
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,549
You seem sad, stranger.

239
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,409
I heard you mention a flood?

240
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,599
Yes, a sudden deluge, without rain or melt to explain it.

241
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,406
I'm Laulai, the drummer of Deep Din.

242
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:48,000
Or at least I was, until it disappeared under the waters.

243
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,158
"Deep Din" — what's that?

244
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:53,390
A hollow carved out by the Old Ones.

245
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,639
A chamber, a basin, and a musical instrument, all at once.

246
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,049
My life, my calling.

247
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,259
During the war, my father played the pipes to rally the Banuk against the Carja.

248
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,318
I'm the drummer now, but our battles are few and far between.

249
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,734
Mostly I play for the joy of it.

250
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,544
Pipes that carry a perfect tone beneath the sonorous basin.

251
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:23,069
A wondrous edifice the Old Ones used to carry music far and wide.

252
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:31,034
Of course, if the waters don't receed what's the point of joy, or remembering?

253
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,709
So the waters came fast.

254
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:38,210
One day it was dry, the next the nearby river
had risen and the entire basin was flooded.

255
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,490
I don't understand it.

256
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,528
There was no rain, not even any clouds.

257
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:46,799
And yet the river rose higher than I'd ever seen it.

258
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,326
And there it remains.

259
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:53,257
A flood without rain, that is strange.

260
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,299
Where is this place?

261
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,447
I'll have a look if I'm in the area.

262
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,147
Just northwest of here.

263
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:02,490
Look all you like, but I don't see what good it'll do.

264
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,769
The flood waters aren't going anywhere.

265
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,259
How does one ask a river to relent?

266
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:13,949
[Banuk warrior]
…where the great weraks go. Perhaps one day I will join them.

267
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,240
[Banuk warrior]
Good hunting today, we reunited many machine spirits with the blue light.

268
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,849
Chill almost feels like sunburn.

269
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,640
[Kamut]
Outlander, wait! Wait a moment.

270
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,777
[Banuk]
Mix your yellow and your blue, that's how you get green.

271
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,440
That weapon of yours, outlander, that spear!

272
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,950
I can see the blue light upon it.

273
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,579
You're not the first to take an interest in it.

274
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,308
I've made it myself.

275
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,679
Your own design?

276
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,119
And yet you are not a Shaman.

277
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,108
Uh, no more of a tinker.

278
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:20,630
A tinker does not understand the spark in the metal,
the song in the metal, like this.

279
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,190
But it could be improved upon, modified, with the help of the Old Ones.

280
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Far north of here there is a cave, a shaft in the snow.

281
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,239
Within it is a nest of metal birds.

282
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,308
Find a bird that hasn't been stripped by Shamans past.

283
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:42,019
Look for a rail inside it, the length of your spear.

284
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:43,788
That's all I can tell you.

285
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:46,916
Get a rail from some metal birds in a cave.

286
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,950
Sounds perfectly normal.

287
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,960
[Kamut]
A secret shared is kept beneath ice.

288
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,000
[Banuk]
…then act surprised when the hunt eludes them.

289
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,950
[Banuk]
…we will not bow to this…

290
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,459
[Banuk hunter 1]
Any news from the hunt?

291
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,450
[Banuk hunter 2]
The herd isn't roaming far from the camp.

292
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,639
[Banuk hunter 3]
Keeping together this time.

293
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,889
[Banuk hunter 2]
Then we wait, but I bet we'll see a stray.

294
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,052
[Banuk hunter 1]
Alright, I'll keep watch tonight.

295
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,000
Outlanders. Carja outlanders.

296
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,208
[Carja outlander]
…said her lover was killed by machines.

297
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:56,287
[Carja outlander]
I'm sure it's a lie but with so many dying recently…

298
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,578
[Hishavan]
May the sun grant you a portion of its wisdom, young huntress.

299
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,408
What brings you Carja so far from your home?

300
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,670
There's good machine hunting in The Cut, danger too.

301
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,960
Some have a taste for both, and they pay people like me well to guide them.

302
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,898
We've had a bad run this time.

303
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,951
Even after I brought this priest along to read the signs…

304
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:30,005
I did say the sun's light was cast quite red the night of the…

305
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,550
Not your concern though, huntress.

306
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,630
[Furahni]
You're a long way from home too. Watch your back out there.

307
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,530
[Carja outlander]
An Oseram tries to kill the Sun-King and a Nora saves his life!

308
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,340
Burgrend said Ourea's apprentice went north of the river.

309
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:57,239
Hopefully not too far.

310
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,409
That must be Naltuk looking out at that … tower.

311
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:02,739
It looks like it's sending out a pulse or signal.

312
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:07,858
Naltuk.

313
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,949
Who are you?

314
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,528
How did you find me?

315
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,338
Burgrend told me you'd be out here.

316
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,739
He's persistent.

317
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:18,534
I've told that Oseram a thousand times I don't need to buy anything.

318
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:21,434
And I'm not selling. I just need to find Ourea.

319
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:22,639
Well, you won't.

320
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,607
She's gone where only Shamans can tread.

321
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,259
She seeks guidance from the voice in the blue light.

322
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,030
That is her task.

323
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,844
And the task she gave me is to observe the Daemon's work.

324
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,960
To stop it spreading, if I can.

325
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,610
But what can I do about these towers?

326
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,070
In only a few weeks they've sprouted throughout The Cut.

327
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:48,253
The Daemon's energy pulses from them.

328
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:51,530
Rallies the machines, even repairs them.

329
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,738
Aratak said this Daemon was frenzying machines?

330
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:55,829
Look there.

331
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,429
Those with the purple markings, they belong to the Daemon.

332
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,918
They're stronger, more dangerous.

333
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,639
I've seen something like this before, a corruption.

334
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,703
But it wasn't from your Daemon.

335
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:08,690
You have?

336
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,789
Well, then you know more than I do.

337
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,400
These towers, were they part of your corruption?

338
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,878
No, those are new to me too.

339
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,139
Like I said, they empower the Daemon's machines.

340
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,018
They must be stopped.

341
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,667
Will you tell me where Ourea went?

342
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:25,434
You ask a lot of questions.

343
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:27,318
Only when I'm not getting the answers I need.

344
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,139
There's but one voice Ourea wants to hear right now, and it isn't yours.

345
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,690
I'm sorry.

346
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,900
Alright, you want to stop the spread of the Daemon's work?

347
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,554
I know how to get started — with my bow and spear.

348
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:40,829
Outlander, wait!

349
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,969
Won't you tell me your name?

350
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,719
Aloy.

351
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,019
Good.

352
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,478
If you fall to the Daemon's machines,
at least I can properly recount your efforts to Ourea.

353
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,050
Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I won't fall.

354
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,739
And when I'm done, you're gonna tell me where she is.

355
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:15,679
Interesting.

356
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,269
Maybe I could override it.

357
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:08,442
I can kill the machines, but what about the tower?

358
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,802
I might be able to destroy it, or override it.

359
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:33,363
The tower won't stop, but I could override it.

360
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,918
Okay, then let's see if this tower will work for me.

361
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:35,412
So the tower helps heal the machines, and it can be overridden.

362
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:24,409
[Naltuk, in the distance]
Let's talk about Ourea.

363
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,500
[Naltuk]
You are quite the warrior.

364
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,034
Seems I can take care of the machines and towers, the Daemon's next.

365
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,091
You claimed its power for yourself, somehow.

366
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,267
Perhaps Ourea should meet you after all.

367
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,590
What she truly seeks is hope.

368
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,699
After what I just saw, you could show her that.

369
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,253
She's in retreat beyond those mountains, the Icerasps.

370
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,989
You'll have to walk the Shaman's Path to get there.

371
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,467
Burgrend told me you're Ourea's apprentice.

372
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:31,034
In her absence, I serve the chieftain and his werak
as an advisor, a scout, a speaker for the blue light.

373
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:32,178
Lot of responsibilities.

374
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:36,420
I don't know if I can live up to Ourea's example, but I have to try.

375
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,289
I owe her that much.

376
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:43,550
She took a chance on me, an aspiring Shaman from the edge of the world.

377
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,820
No-one else would.

378
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:47,509
Were you with Ourea when they attacked the mountain?

379
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,590
I wish I had been, even with all that happened.

380
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,789
I'm no warrior, though, so she bid me wait.

381
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:59,420
When Ourea and the chieftain returned, I saw them argue bitterly.

382
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,050
I don't know what about exactly.

383
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,650
Then she came to me, gave me my task, and left us.

384
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:09,068
How do I cross this Shaman's Path?

385
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,935
Go to the Icerasps.

386
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:15,920
Then follow the markers through the ice caves
and the waterfalls, and make the climb to the shrine.

387
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,590
But be careful.

388
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,608
The path is meant to be an ordeal.

389
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,818
The final trial of a young Shaman's training.

390
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,708
And I'll find Ourea at the end of it?

391
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,163
No, she goes further up, somewhere inside the mountain.

392
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:33,625
You'll know you've reached the end when you come to a shrine,
a great machine covered in bluegleam.

393
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,743
A crystal that builds on the bodies of machines in the oldest ice.

394
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,590
We Banuk believe it's the stuff of the blue light frozen as it escapes their shells.

395
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:47,828
You might be more interested that merchants will trade well for it.

396
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,219
Shamans who complete the path take a piece of it as reward.

397
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,766
If you make it that far, you should too. You'll have earned it.

398
00:47:56,766 --> 00:48:02,159
If you see her, would you tell her I have faith she will hear the voice again.

399
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,438
Alright, I guess I'm off to the Icerasps to find this Shaman's Path.

400
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:11,309
Never know when I might need these.
