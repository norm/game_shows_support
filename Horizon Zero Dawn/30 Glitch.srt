00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,386
[Computer]
Genetic profile confirmed. Entry authorised.

2
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,460
[Computer]
Greetings, Doctor Sobeck. Please, step inside.

3
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:14,569
[Computer]
Doctor Sobeck, you are 355,510 days overdue for your meeting with Mr Faro.

4
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,359
[Computer]
Please proceed to the 35th floor.

5
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,808
Wait, wait, wait … three hundred and fifty thousand?

6
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,950
That's hundreds of years ago.

7
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,549
What's going on?

8
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,389
Forget about travelling light.

9
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,558
[first recorded voice]
The protocols used polyphasic entangled waveforms.

10
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,069
[first recorded voice]
Quantum encryption, black quartz stuff, way beyond military grade.

11
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,788
[first recorded voice]
That's what you demanded.

12
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,538
[first recorded voice]
So that's what we delivered.

13
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,250
[second recorded voice]
You don't code something you can't crack.

14
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,050
[second recorded voice]
All we need is a backdoor.

15
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,338
[second recorded voice]
Upload the latest service update and the problem goes away.

16
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,748
[first recorded voice]
You specifically forbade us from leaving anything resembling a backdoor in code.

17
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,418
[first recorded voice]
Every protocol to Black Quartz standard, your words.

18
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:03,188
[first recorded voice]
Look, if you need me to fudge some projections,
it's nothing we haven't done before.

19
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,550
[second recorded voice]
I don't need fudged projections!

20
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,349
[second recorded voice]
I need a way to reassert control over the Hartz-Timor swarm.

21
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,555
[first recorded voice]
I don't know what to tell you, Ted.

22
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,449
[first recorded voice]
You're asking the impossible.

23
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,269
So, codes.

24
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,350
They needed codes of some kind to control the machines,
but they got out of control.

25
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,149
Sounds bad.

26
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,350
I can't spare the weight.

27
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,850
A Deathbringer.

28
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,934
Or a statue of one, anyway.

29
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,519
A machine built to kill. And they honoured it?

30
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:27,315
[Hologram]
Welcome to Faro Automated Solutions, where
all the problems of tomorrow are being solved today.

31
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:33,635
[Hologram]
With over 25,000 human employees
based in nations and corporate holdings across the globe,

32
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:39,758
[Hologram]
Faro leads the world in every sector
of self sustaining, fully automated technology.

33
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:44,233
[Hologram]
From revolutionary consumer products close to home,
like the Faro Focus,

34
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:50,565
[Hologram]
to the dynamic Chariot line of peace-keeping robots
halting bloodshed in conflict zones across the globe,

35
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:58,250
[Hologram]
Faro remains committed to making the future
smarter, brighter, safer, and always surprising.

36
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,240
[Hologram]
Faro Automated Solutions.
For every problem of life, a smart solution.

37
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,550
[Aloy]
So they made the Focus.

38
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,639
25,000 people? That's bigger than a tribe.

39
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,189
So they made machines and devices.

40
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,149
I guess those things were common in their world.

41
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,750
What was this place?

42
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,610
What were they doing here?

43
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,550
[voice from Focus]
It was a corporation.

44
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,750
[voice from Focus]
A group of people, not unlike a tribe.

45
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,649
[voice from Focus]
And they made machines.

46
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,350
[Aloy]
Yeah, go on.

47
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,290
[voice from Focus]
I've uploated some data files to your Focus.

48
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,050
[voice from Focus]
They'll help you understand.

49
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,649
[Ted Faro]
Now I know this must seem like a bizarre change in direction.

50
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,510
[Ted Faro]
I mean, we're Faro Automated Solutions, right?

51
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,950
[Ted Faro]
Number one robotics firm in the world.

52
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,469
[Ted Faro]
Why would we clear our production slate to fabricate
human operated vehicles and weapons systems?

53
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,250
[Ted Faro]
The relics of the past.

54
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,070
[Ted Faro]
All I can say at this juncture is…

55
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,940
[Ted Faro]
…trust me.

56
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:52,840
[Ted Faro]
We will be exploiting a massive uh, growth opportunity
by retooling and reallocating capacity according to my plan.

57
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,950
[Ted Faro]
So I will need revised projections of mass fabrication
velocity across every pipeline within 36 hours.

58
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,808
[Aloy]
So they were making machines.

59
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:08,090
Then they stopped to make other kinds of weapons. Why?

60
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,750
The air.

61
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,559
There's no smell to it, not even old death.

62
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,759
Nothing natural.

63
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,740
Should have brought a cart.

64
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,014
Another cave-in, but I could get through.

65
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,009
Looks like I can climb here.

66
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:02,349
I bet I can use that as a ramp to get back up.

67
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,522
Made it.

68
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,838
[Hologram]
The FSP5 Khopesh provides a one-size-fits-all solution
to main battle force capability.

69
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,029
[Hologram]
Metamaterial construction delivers unmatched recoil dampening.

70
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:05,489
[Hologram]
Allowing you to field any weapon package that conforms
to your budget needs and conflict resolution profile.

71
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:12,759
[Hologram]
Patented biomass conversion systems allow
extended emergency operations with minimal environmental impact.

72
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:20,771
[Hologram]
Multilinear target processing provides simultaneous real-time threat analysis
and legal review for autonomous domestic operations.

73
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:26,160
[Hologram]
Or control can be slaved to the swarm's neural network
for weapons-free force application.

74
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,419
[Hologram]
Either way, when it's time to call out the big guns, it's time to call Khopesh.

75
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:33,303
[Aloy]
The Deathbringer.

76
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:37,369
So this was the heavy hitter. "Main battle force" indeed.

77
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:52,796
[Hologram]
The BOR7 Horus.

78
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:59,789
[Hologram]
Imagine your complete engagement ecosystem comprehensively managed
by a high-speed learning machine network.

79
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,636
[Hologram]
Whether your need is to replace battlefield losses or intensify force projection,

80
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:11,839
[Hologram]
the Horus's onboard manufacturing capabilities mean
you'll never get stuck waiting for the next arms delivery.

81
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:21,038
[Hologram]
Simply redefine your force parameters and the Horus will fabricate additional units
to fill the ranks for an affordable per-unit licencing fee.

82
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:29,491
[Hologram]
Meanwhile, the biomass conversion systems of other Chariot line models
allow them to keep the Horus fuelled, repaired, and ready.

83
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:35,400
[Hologram]
Extending its operational tolerances beyond that
of any competing titan-class platform.

84
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,440
[Hologram]
That's the Horus advantage. Always regulating, always ready.

85
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,339
[Hologram]
The future of automated warfare made real today.

86
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,259
[Aloy]
The Metal Devil.

87
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,598
So these were Faro machines too. 

88
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:54,369
"Manufacturing capabilities" — they could make more of themselves.

89
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,748
Then how would you ever stop them?

90
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,272
[Hologram]
The ACA3 Scarab combines conventional
and information warfare capabilities in one package.

91
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:14,473
[Hologram]
Designed for high-speed, all-terrain reconnaissance.

92
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:20,160
[Hologram]
It boasts the world's highest survivability rating
of any scout-class autonomous agent.

93
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:27,118
[Hologram]
Maybe it's the Scarab's emergency biomass conversion systems
that ensure it always makes it back to base.

94
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:30,239
[Hologram]
Even if fuel supply lines have been interdicted.

95
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,818
[Hologram]
Or maybe it's the Scarab's ability to slave enemy robots to its own network.

96
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:38,312
[Hologram]
Now that's force multiplication.

97
00:25:38,312 --> 00:25:42,996
[Hologram]
Add a prehensile manipulator arm that can handle a host of functions.

98
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:50,139
[Hologram]
From 360-degree less lethal riot management,
to surgical repairs of allied Chariot line models.

99
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,180
[Hologram]
And you've got the workhorse of any cutting edge peace-keeping fleet.

100
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,175
[Aloy]
The Corruptor.

101
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:59,309
"Slave enemy robots to its own network".

102
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,579
Sounds like its talking about how it corrupts machines.

103
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:34,950
I'd have to ditch something.

104
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,299
So people were angry at Faro.

105
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,990
At the corporation.

106
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,049
They blamed this place for something, something bad.

107
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,349
Looks like the way up.

108
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,259
What's left of it.

109
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,660
Gonna be a long way up.

110
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,849
Frozen metal most of the way.

111
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,578
You're not making this easy, Doctor Sobeck.

112
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,670
If plants can find a way to hang on up here, guess I can too.

113
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,349
Freezing out here.

114
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:32,849
[Ted Faro]
…that began when they engaged in unauthorised offensive operations against robots and human personnel of the Hartz-Timor Energy Combine.

115
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,849
[Ted Faro]
Now I wish that I could relay that the crisis has been…

116
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,250
[Ted Faro]
…exaggerated, but it's not.

117
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,428
[Ted Faro]
The peacekeepers have not responded to stand down codes.

118
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:51,139
[Ted Faro]
And by all signs they appear to be replicating at a… precipitous rate.

119
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,433
[Ted Faro]
Now what I can promise you and absolutely assure you…

120
00:34:55,433 --> 00:35:03,038
[Ted Faro]
…is that I am already devoting every possible resource
towards reaching a speedy conclusion to this issue.

121
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,711
[Ted Faro]
So when you hear the bad talk about us, against this company,

122
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:11,708
[Ted Faro]
in the days, maybe weeks, to come,
just bear in mind that we will get past this.

123
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,659
[Ted Faro]
And a day's coming when none of this will matter.

124
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,239
[Aloy]
"Peacekeepers" — that's what they called their machines?

125
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,059
They were built for war, not peace.

126
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:09,070
Tasty.

127
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,260
Got too much already.

128
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,809
A way up.

129
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:34,119
All it takes is a few good handholds.

130
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,695
All right, made it. Wonder what we'll find?

131
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,449
I'd have to ditch something.

132
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,590
A power cell.

133
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,170
I'll need it to get to the armour in that ancient ruin I found.

134
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:55,699
Should've brought a cart.

135
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:12,972
[Computer]
All data has been erased from this device.

136
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:16,070
[Computer]
Do you wish to deploy Alpha privileges to recover purged data?

137
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,840
[Aloy]
Yes, I believe I do.

138
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,560
[Computer]
A file has been recovered.

139
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,099
[Ted Faro]
Elisabet, good to, uh…

140
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,398
[Ted Faro]
It's been years.

141
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,068
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Where's your legal team, Ted?

142
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,254
[Ted Faro]
No need, I dropped all 18 lawsuits the moment you landed.

143
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,139
[Ted Faro]
I assume your data confirms this?

144
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,460
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Alright, this promises to be interesting.

145
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,010
[Ted Faro]
Perhaps we could have lunch brought in.

146
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,214
[Ted Faro]
You know, get reacquainted…

147
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:04,659
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I know you Ted, you've screwed something up.

148
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,624
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Something big, or you wouldn't have eaten the crow necessary to get me here.

149
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:09,900
[Elisabet Sobeck]
So spit it out.

150
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,139
[Ted Faro]
There's … a glitch in the Chariot line.

151
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,578
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Your killer robots?

152
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:18,972
[Ted Faro]
Peacekeepers, yes, those.

153
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,210
[Elisabet Sobeck]
So shut them down.

154
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,301
[Ted Faro]
Obviously Liz, we would if we could.

155
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,578
[Ted Faro]
They're not responding.

156
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,448
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Are you telling me a swarm has gone rogue, Ted?

157
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,590
[Ted Faro]
It's worse than that.

158
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,099
[Elisabet Sobeck]
 [sighs] Show me the data then.

159
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,500
[Elisabet Sobeck]
And I'll take that lunch, alone.

160
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,449
Ted Faro brought Elisabet Sobeck here? But they hated each other.

161
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,679
[Computer]
Another file has been recovered.

162
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,489
[Elisabet Sobeck]
This isn't a "glitch".

163
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,318
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It's a catastrophe.

164
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,699
[Ted Faro]
Fully aware.

165
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,668
[Ted Faro]
It's bad.

166
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,366
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Bad?

167
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:03,408
[Ted Faro]
Jesus, Liz.

168
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,318
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It's not bad, Ted.

169
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,068
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It's apocalyptic.

170
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,369
[Elisabet Sobeck]
You built a line of killer robots…

171
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:10,928
[Ted Faro]
Peacekeepers!

172
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:13,317
[Elisabet Sobeck]
…that consume biomass as fuel!

173
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:14,788
[Ted Faro]
In emergencies!

174
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:17,238
[Elisabet Sobeck]
And you made them capable of self-replication!

175
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:20,078
[Ted Faro]
Limited self-manufacture, controlled.

176
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,389
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Not any more.

177
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:23,608
[Elisabet Sobeck]
The glitch severed chain of command.

178
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,538
[Elisabet Sobeck]
The only nation this swarm answers to now is itself.

179
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:27,774
[Ted Faro]
You, you think I di–

180
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,523
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Everything else is just food!

181
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:34,619
[Elisabet Sobeck]
And at the rate it's replicating, Ted, it will strip the Earth bare in fifteen months.

182
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,239
[Elisabet Sobeck]
We're not talking the fall of civilisation.

183
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,118
[Elisabet Sobeck]
We're talking extinction.

184
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,280
[Ted Faro]
I get it, Liz.

185
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,570
[Ted Faro]
So how do I stop it while it's contained?

186
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,820
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It's not contained, it can't be!

187
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,280
[Ted Faro]
You know what I mean!

188
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,436
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Right, before the truth gets out, you mean.

189
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:53,889
[Ted Faro]
Liz, I will do anything you say.

190
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,772
[Ted Faro]
Keep working it, and whatever you recommend, I'll do.

191
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,889
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I'm gonna hold you to that, Ted.

192
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:14,760
The Faro robots threatened all life on Earth, but somehow she defeated them.

193
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,989
The world of the Old Ones fell but life went on, or we wouldn't be here.

194
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,495
[Computer]
A final file has been recovered.

195
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,780
[Ted Faro]
"Project Zero Dawn"?

196
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:37,369
[Ted Faro]
Jesus, Liz. There has to be another way.

197
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:40,604
[Elisabet Sobeck]
If there were a nicer way to fix your mess, I would have proposed it.

198
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,070
[Ted Faro]
But this? This?!

199
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:48,134
[Ted Faro]
When I asked you to find a cure, I didn't expect it to be worse than the disease.

200
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:49,599
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It's not, Ted.

201
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,618
[Elisabet Sobeck]
It may be grim, but it's our only chance.

202
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,389
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Now sign the proposal.

203
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:57,256
[Ted Faro]
Sign it? I can't sign that!

204
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,190
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Yes, you can.

205
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:03,626
[Ted Faro]
That? Liz, I cannot in good conscience sign that.

206
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,610
[Elisabet Sobeck]
You've got a choice, Ted.

207
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,880
[Ted Faro]
I know.

208
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,130
[Elisabet Sobeck]
I'm speaking to you from a VTOL en-route to U.S. Robot Command.

209
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,048
[Elisabet Sobeck]
In fifteen minutes, I meet with General Harris and the rest of the Joint Chiefs.

210
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,510
[Ted Faro]
Wh—what?! Are you crazy?

211
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,678
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Now your choice is what I tell them.

212
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:28,880
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Sign and I'll tell them the wealthiest corporation on Earth
has guaranteed the funds necessary to build Zero Dawn.

213
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:32,137
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Exactly as I've designed it.

214
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:38,289
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Or don't sign and I will make sure they,
and everyone else on this planet, knows the real cause of the glitch.

215
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,824
[Ted Faro]
Jesus, Liz.

216
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:43,858
[Ted Faro]
You don't have to threaten me.

217
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:46,810
[Ted Faro]
I'll sign.

218
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,050
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Look on the bright side, Ted.

219
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,583
[Elisabet Sobeck]
From here on out you get to do what you've always been good at.

220
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,369
[Elisabet Sobeck]
Footing the bill while others get their hands dirty.

221
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,187
[Ted Faro]
God forgive me.

222
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,570
What made her solution so terrible?

223
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,190
What did she do to stop the robots?

224
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:24,110
[Computer]
Executive access detected. Express lift opened.

225
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,179
This, this doesn't add up.

226
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,468
Sobeck couldn't have been my mother.

227
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,480
She lived ages ago.

228
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,908
All this searching and I'm still no closer.

229
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:42,852
[voice from Focus]
That's your reaction to everything you just learned?

230
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:45,289
[voice from Focus]
To whine like a spoiled child?

231
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,154
You should really try talking that way to me face to face!

232
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,309
As you wish.

233
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:58,409
Do you really have no idea how monumental
are the discoveries you just made, Aloy?

234
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,320
I expected more of you.

235
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,480
So, you have a face.

236
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,168
Got a name to go with it?

237
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:11,199
Of all the questions you could ask right now, that's the one you choose?

238
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:19,190
I've spent decades searching the ruins of the Old Ones,
trying to solve the mystery of what happened to them.

239
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:23,438
For years I've suspected that Faro robots destroyed their civilisation.

240
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,928
But I could never confirm it.

241
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:29,308
And in minutes you uncover more ancient knowledge than I have in a lifetime.

242
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:33,228
And what you want to know is my name?

243
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:39,260
If you're so smart, why do you know so little
after a lifetime scratching around in the dirt?

244
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:41,698
It's not my fault you're bad at what you do.

245
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:44,615
I came to these ruins looking for Elisabet Sobeck.

246
00:52:44,615 --> 00:52:50,182
Not because of the things she did centuries ago,
but because people are trying to kill me right now, today!

247
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,598
I've got bigger problems to deal with than your crap.

248
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,380
Congratulations.

249
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:59,138
You just graduated from whining to throwing a temper tantrum.

250
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:01,690
I'm sure Elisabet would be proud.

251
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:07,554
You have no idea what I've been through, how hard it's been.

252
00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:11,368
My whole life I grew up not knowing who I am or where I came from.

253
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:15,976
And then come the Eclipse trying to kill me,
just because I look like this Elisabet Sobeck woman.

254
00:53:15,976 --> 00:53:19,940
And they killed the man who raised you,
and you were found in the mountain as a baby.

255
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,708
I already know this through your Focus.

256
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:28,059
You've been getting a free ride on my Focus,
risking nothing while I risk everything.

257
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,880
All I have to do is take this thing off my head
and you'll be blind, deaf, and dumb.

258
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,966
So quit complaining and answer my questions.

259
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:41,914
Very well. Sylens. That's my name.

260
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:45,360
Now, why don't you try asking another question?

261
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,585
Something less trivial.

262
00:53:47,585 --> 00:53:52,000
Every time I take a step forward, the answer slipped farther from my grasp.

263
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:54,948
[sighs] You just don't understand.

264
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:57,210
It's not that I don't understand, Aloy.

265
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,380
It's that I don't care.

266
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:04,960
If the answers keep slipping away every step you take,
then you'd best start running to catch up.

267
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:09,769
Maybe then you'll realise just how big your problems really are.

268
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:13,389
Alright Sylens, you've made your point.

269
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,336
I came to these ruins hoping to learn more
about this Elisabet Sobeck, and I have.

270
00:54:20,336 --> 00:54:28,081
But I still don't understand my connection to her,
or why the Eclipse is trying to kill me, or who Hades is…

271
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,800
No answers, just one question after another.

272
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,518
Who are you Sylens, and what are your intentions?

273
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,570
You really need to make this personal?

274
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,309
I'm a lone wanderer who left his tribe behind a long time ago.

275
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,250
An explorer of forbidden places, a searcher of lost knowledge.

276
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:52,012
Exactly as I said.

277
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:54,348
Why do you know so much about the Eclipse?

278
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:57,400
I happen to know a lot about a lot of things.

279
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:02,750
If what you're really asking is whether I work
for the Eclipse or anyone else, I don't.

280
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,750
I'm nothing if not independent.

281
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,599
You've been using my Focus to spy on me.

282
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,108
How is that possible?

283
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,925
Every Focus emits a signal.

284
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:16,159
A voice that only other Focuses can hear.

285
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:18,116
I know how to string those voices together.

286
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:22,118
How to make them talk to each other, to communicate even over vast distances.

287
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,988
How do you learn to do that?

288
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,760
Years of study and experimentation.

289
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:31,750
In principle, it's not so different from how you override machines.

290
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,384
I override Focuses.

291
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:37,298
And you can spy through other Eclipse's Focuses too?

292
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,510
Usually.

293
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:45,838
All I'll say is that overriding the connections is … complicated.

294
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,750
That thing that spoke to me outside, that made that Focus explode?

295
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,760
That was Hades?

296
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,520
The Eclipse describe him as a buried shadow, some kind of devil.

297
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:02,679
It didn't seem like a person or a machine.

298
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,039
More like a phantom with a terrible voice.

299
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,667
All that certain is that he wants you dead.

300
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:15,355
Because of my connection to Elisabet, has to be.

301
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:19,168
Hades is using the Eclipse to resurrect Faro robots.

302
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:23,978
You said you've known for some time that
Faro war machines destroyed the civilisation of the Old Ones.

303
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,229
The evidence pointed that way.

304
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:30,789
But until now, I never knew the full scope of their danger.

305
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:33,741
That they could process organic matter into fuel.

306
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:37,039
Or that the Horus class could manufacture more robots.

307
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:39,308
Like a cauldron on legs.

308
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:44,378
But the robots we've seen so far,
the Corruptors and Deathbringers, they don't do those things.

309
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,860
Not yet, anyway.

310
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:49,811
So far, we haven't encountered any that are undamaged.

311
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:52,468
At full power who knows what they're capable of?

312
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,576
But if Elisabet found a way to stop them centuries ago…

313
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:58,039
In some of the ancient data I've recovered,

314
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:02,480
there are hints of so-called superweapons being developed.

315
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,688
Maybe Hades is worried I'll do the same thing.

316
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,150
This is speculation.

317
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,840
Wasting time.

318
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,428
Is there any chance that Elisabet Sobeck could still be alive somehow?

319
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,292
It's highly unlikely.

320
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:18,650
She couldn't have been my mother if she lived centuries ago.

321
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,388
Some of the ancient data I've recovered includes mentions of life extension techniques.

322
00:57:24,388 --> 00:57:27,769
Pharmaceuticals mostly, an ancient word for medicine.

323
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:32,506
But some were still trying to perfect ways of freezing and unfreezing people.

324
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,957
Freezing and unfreezing people?

325
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:36,840
Cryogenics, they called it.

326
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,039
But there were problems with it.

327
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,309
Given Elisabet's technological acumen,

328
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:47,039
I can't definitively rule out that she found a way to make herself immortal.

329
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:51,198
The only way to find out is to keep going, to keep making discoveries.

330
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:57,340
Thanks to you, we've only just now learned
that Faro robots once threatened to end life on Earth.

331
00:57:57,429 --> 00:57:59,039
But it didn't happen.

332
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,445
The Old Ones' civilisation was destroyed but life, life was saved.

333
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:08,646
Obviously. So what did Elisabet do?

334
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:13,190
How did she stop the robots before all was lost?

335
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,334
What was Project Zero Dawn?

336
00:58:15,334 --> 00:58:17,600
Exactly the question.

337
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:24,755
Elisabet told Ted Faro she was headed for a place called
"U.S. Robot Command" to tell people about Zero Dawn.

338
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:27,519
The place still exists as a ruin.

339
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:30,537
The Oseram call it the Grave-Hoard.

340
00:58:30,868 --> 00:58:33,488
"Grave-Hoard"? Cheery name.

341
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:37,537
You'll find it in the eastern mountains,
buried under the tangled coils of a Metal Devil.

342
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:41,178
Or a BOR7 Horus rather, as we're learning to call them.

343
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:43,070
I'll contact you when you get there.

344
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,880
I can't wait.

345
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,913
Some day we'll meet in person and your manners had better be improved.

346
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:11,757
Well, getting down will be a lot faster than getting up here at least.

347
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,867
U.S. Robot Command next.

348
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:17,949
To learn the secrets of Zero Dawn.
