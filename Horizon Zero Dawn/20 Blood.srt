1
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,079
Another signal.

2
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,375
The source of the signal must be close.

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,549
I have to climb up to the Tallneck's head.

4
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,590
The killers.

5
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,599
What are they doing here?

6
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,254
[Eclipse thug]
What use is a Tallneck? They don't even fight.

7
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,650
[Eclipse thug]
That nearly skewered me!

8
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,419
[Eclipse thug]
To arms!

9
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:20,222
It looks like they're trying to capture the Tallneck.

10
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,207
[Eclipse thug]
Whose body is this?

11
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:04,339
[Eclipse thug]
This one's dead!

12
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:21,810
So they woke up.

13
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,350
[Eclipse priest]
Who's shooting?

14
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,319
Move along now.

15
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,250
They're giving up.

16
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,250
Rost always said "patience".

17
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,669
Okay, I need to get up to the Tallneck's head.

18
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,460
I should be able to jump onto the Tallneck from here.

19
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,570
Okay, time to climb up to its head.

20
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,960
I'll find a use for you.

21
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,160
These are helpful.

22
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:32,519
Bitter, though.

23
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:38,992
Calm, calm.

24
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,349
Abandoned.

25
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,589
A lot of dead machines.

26
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:39,950
Are those tooth marks on that machine?

27
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,160
Who is that?

28
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,349
Tribal girl.

29
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,470
You're a hunter, machine hunter.

30
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,089
I can smell it on you.

31
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,639
Their oils and fluids.

32
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,160
Oh, your hands are stained.

33
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,049
Can I just scent your fingers?

34
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,980
Uhhh, no.

35
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,910
No, no, no, no, of course not, no.

36
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:30,813
Forgive me, my head, it's … it's addled.

37
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:36,349
Heavy with the taste of metal and lightning and prophecy.

38
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,729
Do you dream of the Metal World huntress?

39
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,740
That's what you Nora call it.

40
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,939
The ancient world?

41
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,190
Yes. Yes!

42
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,739
You've almost touched it.

43
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,269
You hunt the machine, strip the parts, reach into their guts.

44
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,939
Let the sacred fluids run out.

45
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,029
Spilling away into the earth, wasted.

46
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,308
Open your mouth to insight.

47
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:02,818
Drink up, that's what I did.

48
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm Brin.

49
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,549
Uh, you're Banuk. Is this normal for your tribe?

50
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,069
My tribe? My tribe? My tribe?

51
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,769
No tribe!

52
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:21,231
The other Shaman said, "You've drunk in the machine spirit's madness."

53
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:24,500
They said, "This is not the way of things!"

54
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,938
Stripped me out on the ice, left me to die.

55
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,858
Said, "That's the way of things."

56
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:33,299
Cold unending.

57
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,579
They cast you out.

58
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,660
But you survived.

59
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,000
Perhaps.

60
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,225
I remember the chill, pressed in slow, spear-tipped.

61
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:49,049
Tallnecks gathering their great dark heads over me like a garland.

62
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:52,449
Then I was walking again.

63
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,660
Walking back to my once-tribe.

64
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,349
To return is to be forgiven, but I kept walking.

65
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,660
No-one stopped me.

66
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,549
Those wounds.

67
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,490
A Sawtooth gave them to you on the hunt didn't it?

68
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,103
Oh, not just any Sawtooth, not just a hunt.

69
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:20,009
I was low, quiet in the long grass, spear at the ready to bring it down.

70
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:25,349
Then the scent, the taste of its blood overcame me.

71
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,769
I pounced, wrestled it down, bit into it.

72
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:33,910
So close! A shiver through my teeth as they ground along the wires.

73
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,759
But its teeth won out.

74
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,300
You're lucky to be alive, I think.

75
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,867
Until the wounds mend, flower into scars, only my mind can wander.

76
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:51,009
But why not trade, huntress?

77
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,750
You bring me the blood.

78
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,824
I tell you what it reveals.

79
00:29:56,824 --> 00:30:00,009
You really drink the blood of machines?

80
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,950
I heard tales of a tribe from the land where the sun goes at night.

81
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,348
They were suckled from the machines.

82
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,939
No, no, no, it's true.

83
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,450
Took wisdom and strength from it, drew closer to them.

84
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,139
Then the tales go dark.

85
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,160
A whole tribe disappeared.

86
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,596
Maybe because they all died?

87
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:23,349
Drinking machine blood can't be good for you.

88
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,849
Uh, first it made me sick.

89
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,098
Then came the visions, for days and nights.

90
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,349
Machine dreams, huntress.

91
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,646
These dreams you have…?

92
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:39,107
Oh, you're curious. Good!

93
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:41,538
It'll give you a long life.

94
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,758
I wish that for you. That's my blessing.

95
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,398
Now we're sworn, I'll tell you how the visions began.

96
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,961
All is silence. The sky is dark.

97
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,851
I gather up the world and peel it back.

98
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,710
Expose the ancient metal beneath, like skinning a rabbit.

99
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,459
It's warm to the touch, warm as the sun pressed against it.

100
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,608
I feel sound.

101
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,595
My heartbeat is the thunder of titans rising!

102
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:20,449
Machines bigger than mountains, stronger too!

103
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,980
The Metal World carried on their shoulders.

104
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:27,002
I'm not sure I like these visions of yours.

105
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:29,210
Th-th-th-they're an answer!

106
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,549
But to what questions?

107
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,160
I must know.

108
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,259
I'll share?

109
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:43,180
It's been interesting, but I should be on my way.

110
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,808
Roam far, huntress.

111
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,450
And remember, the blood is precious to me, yes.

112
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Good hunting at the Ridge of Veils.

113
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,679
If you fell a Sawtooth bring me what spills, won't you?

114
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,049
Not enough metal in the rain water.

115
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,950
Not for my taste.

116
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,049
Or maybe too much.

117
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:32,679
Dust feels like it's under my skin.

118
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,039
Need to keep the upper hand.

119
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,963
The wire isn't long enough.

120
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,009
Now they're hunting me.

121
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,619
Brin says the blood is precious.

122
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,139
Okay.

123
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,818
Ah, huntress!

124
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,199
You've brought me the blood of the Sawtooth.

125
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:46,329
Yes, I smelled it a hill away.

126
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,030
Don't make me regret it.

127
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:55,600
No matter what you hear, what screams, keep your distance.

128
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,840
Starting to regret it.

129
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:07,548
Before the time of the Sawtooth, the machines ran as one pack.

130
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:12,849
Metal drumming on metal, keeping pace out to the lightning's edge.

131
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,068
The rumble of low storms, that's them in motion.

132
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,878
And then a confusion.

133
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,130
Something has changed.

134
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:29,130
The great direction breaks, splits off like a dead branch.

135
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:36,079
They're tumbling now. When they recover, violence is what they know.

136
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,784
Now metal screeches on metal.

137
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:41,667
A death dance.

138
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:46,239
Learned from wars before our eyes had learned to see.

139
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,592
The Sawtooth, the Ravager, they hunt in the long shadows of others.

140
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:56,630
Jagged shapes, old shapes, with bloody eyes.

141
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:04,260
And the machines no longer rise and swell as one thing, an all-thing.

142
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,730
You're quite the storyteller.

143
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,710
But what's it mean?

144
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:14,519
Oh, meaning is not for me to say. Only what I saw.

145
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,590
And you saw all that?

146
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,248
Yes!

147
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,001
Doesn't it make you wonder?

148
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,361
The machines that drive other machines mad.

149
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:27,716
Corruptors! It's their venom I must taste next.

150
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,929
Do you have any idea what that could do to you?

151
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,928
You've drunk it before, of course you have.

152
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,973
I found fallen ones on Coiled Canyon's cliffs.

153
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:41,538
Under the sun, it boiled inside them.

154
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:45,730
The vapour, intoxicating!

155
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,489
Save these for the trail.

156
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,699
Uh-oh, spotted!

157
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,570
Now they're hunting me.

158
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,072
Ha ha!

159
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:54,570
Ugh, the stink!

160
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,469
Stocking up.

161
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:46,420
Sunset, maybe a chance to rest.

162
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,239
They're scanning for me.

163
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,739
Can stop tensing up.

164
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,019
Just stay out of their way for now.

165
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,879
So did you smell this blood coming? It stinks.

166
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:13,879
The richest is not always the sweetest, huntress.

167
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:19,729
In the jungles of the Jewel a fruit grows but reeks of spoiled meat.

168
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,901
Taste it though, honey to the tongue!

169
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:27,920
No.

170
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,519
This is disgusting.

171
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,792
These Corruptors never belonged to the herds.

172
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:43,940
They crawl from beneath desert or rust, from the bones of old machines.

173
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,958
Sickness to spread.

174
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,630
That's how they came.

175
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:54,579
Cold metal runs hot, buckles with thorn cuts and tail stings.

176
01:01:55,369 --> 01:01:57,380
A fever of obedience.

177
01:01:57,409 --> 01:02:00,038
My ears are ringing!

178
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:08,420
I grasp at my tongue, an ingot falls out, stamped with circles and lines.

179
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,998
Directions, instructions, to break a machine's will.

180
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,639
I heard the metal screaming, huntress.

181
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,809
I leave the ingot where it falls.

182
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,332
This isn't for us to know.

183
01:02:24,332 --> 01:02:28,219
Corruptor after Corruptor tramples it in their greedy tread.

184
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,510
That is how they work.

185
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,940
Kind of.

186
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,219
How do you know these things?

187
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,659
It's not what I know, huntress.

188
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:40,139
It's what the blood knows.

189
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,420
Am I the singer or the song?

190
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:45,920
I don't know what you are.

191
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:48,610
Maybe get some rest.

192
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,719
No rest when there's unknown journeys to prepare for.

193
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,891
Do you know of the hidden machines that hunt men deep in the Jewel?

194
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,158
Stalkers? Yes, I know of them.

195
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:06,239
Oh, Stalker blood next?

196
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,809
Sure, why not.

197
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,920
Change comes in rushes, huntress, like time around an arrow.
