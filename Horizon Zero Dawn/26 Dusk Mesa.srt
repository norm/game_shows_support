1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,038
Hey, Fernund, my eyes are up here.

2
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,890
I'm looking at your spear.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,510
It's magnificent.

4
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,449
But, how does it work?

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,049
You stick the pointy end into the machine.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,350
Yes, but, how does it turn foe into friend?

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,000
It's simple, really.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,350
Yes?

9
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:39,990
You wouldn't understand.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,689
What's your proposal?

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,638
During the reign of that idiot Carja king,

12
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:48,532
outlanders often hid items of value from raiders.

13
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,659
Well, I found one.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,049
What is it?

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,679
A relic from the Old Ones.

16
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,000
You probably would understand it better than I do.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,350
Unfortunately, it's too high for me to reach.

18
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,750
Uh-huh, and you want me to get it for you?

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,049
What a brilliant plan!

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,250
You're a much better climber than I am, to be sure.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,549
Get it, bring it back, and we'll split the proceeds.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,549
You're going down!

23
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,799
They're scanning for me.

24
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,210
I dropped it!

25
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,959
It's looking good.

26
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,267
Ready or not…

27
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,269
I'll tuck that away.

28
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,899
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

29
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,950
I'm ready, gotta be.

30
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,950
Just stay out of their way for now.

31
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,909
There!

32
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,500
Low and quiet does it.

33
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,269
Lucky me.

34
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,039
Dusk Mesa.

35
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,855
Now I need to find someplace too high to reach.

36
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:28,180
If I'm to believe anything Fernund said.

37
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,960
I'll find a use for you.

38
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,279
Well, what do you know?

39
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,739
Aaaand it's empty.

40
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,299
[in the distance]
Spear girl!

41
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,024
Of course.

42
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:19,568
You found it.

43
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:22,599
The perfect location for an ambush.

44
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:28,150
Now throw down that magnificent spear and we'll let you live.

45
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,989
You've obviously heard of me.

46
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,789
You know what I'm capable of.

47
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,619
Why do you think this will turn out well for you?

48
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,380
I like the odds.

49
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:39,849
Get her!

50
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:42,710
Why do I bother?

51
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,730
You can see them, they can't see you.

52
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,339
[Outlander mercenary]
She's up on high!

53
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,667
[Carja outlander]
In the name of the Sun, fight back!

54
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,259
That's the last of them.

55
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,900
But Fernund ran off.

56
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,940
Back to the Meridian docks, I'll bet.

57
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,430
I'd have to leave something else behind.

58
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:02,750
Keep that for later.

59
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,834
[Carja guard]
Don't ask me where to go if you're lost.

60
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,436
[Carja guard]
I'm a guard, not the Town Crier.

61
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,337
[Carja guard]
Machines or bandits try to get past me, they'll have a fight. 
Mark my words.

62
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,500
Your aid to the Carja Sundom
in these times of strife is appreciated.

63
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:52,679
That's the official response.

64
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,380
I'd say I can tell you've done the work by the look on your face.

65
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,799
Two of them got themselves killed.

66
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,119
The other welcomed a fight to the end.

67
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,450
They would have found death with or without you,
taken others with them.

68
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,275
That's what I told myself.

69
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:14,950
Smart girl. Doubt we'll meet again, so go in light.

70
00:30:15,328 --> 00:30:18,849
[Prisoner]
There's nothing so strange about old men dying…

71
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,440
[Carja guard]
Don't look to me, I'm just a guard.

72
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,758
[Carja guard]
I don't get involved in politics.

73
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,965
[Carja guard]
Had to take over my brother's shift today.

74
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:40,567
[Carja guard]
It's the Sun's rise and he's off in the court playing nobleman.

75
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,049
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday sun. Words to live by.

76
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:42,150
Apocashitstorm Tour, day seven.

77
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,328
I was three months out of rehab
when we went camping out here.

78
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,829
Wyatt went to sleep early.

79
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:50,458
So it was just the two of us.

80
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,819
When we stayed up and watched the Perseids.

81
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:57,239
After, as we talked about the stars and space tech,

82
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:00,728
I suddenly knew what I wanted to do with my life.

83
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,579
Shadows are getting long.

84
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,530
Low and quiet does it.

85
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,320
Passed the test.

86
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,309
Quietly…

87
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,010
[Cultist]
…here, doesn't look good.

88
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,719
Eclipse. What are they doing here?

89
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,809
They're still looking.

90
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,310
[Cultist]
There's something in that grass over there.

91
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,099
Should've brought a cart.
