1
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:29,028
GAIA: Go to the ruins of Gaia Prime,
find the control room, and within it the master override.

2
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,714
This will give you the power to purge Hades so long as you find a way to wield it.

3
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:38,302
Do not attempt repair of the system core until Hades is eradicated.

4
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,817
Hades must be destroyed.

5
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,321
That is all.

6
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,250
I only wish that I could hear your voice again.

7
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,434
Snow. It's not getting any warmer out here.

8
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,250
This old place, I haven't been here in years.

9
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,210
Wonder what I can find?

10
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,719
You're a question waiting for an answer.

11
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,198
That area back there, I wonder if I can find a way into it now that I'm older?

12
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,000
SKYLAR RIVERA: Director Evans.

13
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,167
SKYLAR RIVERA: Flash traffic from USRC, black quartz encryption.

14
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,561
SKYLAR RIVERA: I've routed the message to your hologrid for viewing.

15
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,250
Another power cell.

16
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,399
I only need one more to get to that ancient armour I found.

17
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,980
No space.

18
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,049
Need them soon enough.

19
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,352
It's okay, don't kick.

20
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,340
Those machines are alert.

21
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll find a use for you.

22
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:53,591
Calm, calm.

23
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:58,188
Saving these for the trail.

24
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,582
Hoping they'd miss me.

25
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,000
Just stay out of their way for now.

26
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,470
Well, here I am.

27
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,340
BANDIT: Give us what you got!

28
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:45,477
OSERAM: By the forge, I believe I've earned a drink or two!

29
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,259
OSERAM: —like an opportunity—

30
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,848
OSERAM: Girl, what are you doing to that machine? It's not a toy! 

31
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,521
Keep quiet now.

32
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,125
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: The way to the mountain will be hard.

33
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,452
SYLENS: Ferocious machines prowl every step of the climb.

34
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:37,849
ALOY: More corrupted?

35
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,300
SYLENS: Not corrupted, but they will not tolerate humans.

36
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,980
ALOY: So what else is new?

37
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,751
[whistle]

38
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,039
ALOY: Stalkers in the open, Watchers on the other side.

39
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,599
ALOY: This will help.

40
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,230
ALOY: Do they think they're guarding Gaia?

41
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,531
SYLENS: I doubt they think all.

42
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,525
SYLENS: More like an instinct, gathering them to her grave.

43
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,131
ALOY: Now I know what they're guarding.

44
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,239
ALOY: More than equipped to take you on!

45
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:11,876
ALOY: My turn.

46
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:45,199
ALOY: Down you go!

47
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:37,989
ALOY: Guessing that I'm almost there.

48
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,810
SYLENS: Correct.

49
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,571
ALOY: Here they come. 

50
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:40,570
ALOY: That one held! 

51
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,170
ALOY: I can get out of this.

52
00:53:06,178 --> 00:53:07,570
ALOY: Here they come. 

53
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,070
ALOY: It's too weak.

54
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:29,517
ALOY: That'd better have been the biggest guard you've got, Gaia.

55
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:44,540
ALOY: This fluid's powerful. Burns at my fingers, but not like the corruption does.

56
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,329
ALOY: I'll tuck that away.

57
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,940
ALOY: It's cold.
