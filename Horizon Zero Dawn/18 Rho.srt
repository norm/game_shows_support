1
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,049
Let's get on with it!

2
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,770
Calm, calm.

3
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,650
Back to your business.

4
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,360
Nutritious.

5
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,350
My Focus is picking up some kind of signal.

6
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,269
Maybe I could scan it.

7
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,850
This'll last.

8
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,389
Okay, they're heading back.

9
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,759
Just stay out of their way for now.

10
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,269
Can stop tensing up.

11
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,740
I can still get the upper hand.

12
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,198
They're scanning for me.

13
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,559
I thought they'd go on forever.

14
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,450
A cauldron.

15
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,165
There's gotta be a way in, somehow.

16
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,750
I wonder what's down here.

17
00:13:57,082 --> 00:14:00,701
Some kind of liquid flowing through that pipe.

18
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,339
Looks like I'm not the first to look for a way in.

19
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,019
What a waste.

20
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,350
These will keep.

21
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,593
They were curious too, but I'm better prepared.

22
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:25,323
I hope it's enough.

23
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,370
That circular device.

24
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,850
What does it do?

25
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,059
Looks like things are going my way.

26
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,980
That rushing sound again.

27
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,160
Need to find a way through that shell.

28
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,970
Can't have you giving away the hunt.

29
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,212
Makes this a little easier.

30
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,260
Alright, that should get me through.

31
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:00,000
Not this time.

32
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,660
Save these for the trail.

33
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,099
Easier when I was a kid.

34
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,259
Saving these for the trail.

35
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:03,555
You're down, the others haven't noticed.

36
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,638
The machines collect Blaze from the wilds.

37
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,670
And it all flows here, like blood to a heart.

38
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,039
So the Cauldron runs on life itself.

39
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:50,000
Calm, calm.

40
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,509
I need to be closer to use that.

41
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,279
I'm safe, for a few minutes anyway.

42
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,869
Now's my chance!

43
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,780
Low and quiet does it.

44
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,570
I'd have to ditch something.

45
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,159
You're alert.

46
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,880
I'd have to leave something else behind.

47
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,398
That's where I need to go.

48
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,579
The belly of this giant beast.

49
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,179
Can't be too prepared.

50
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:58,119
That's where I need to go.

51
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,090
Can't carry more.

52
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,889
They're scanning for me.

53
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:51,630
Red light!

54
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,119
This is beginning to get a lot harder.

55
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,960
Passed the test.

56
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:09,760
That's it, more machines I can override.
