00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,800
[whistle]

2
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,649
Uh-oh, spotted!

3
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,160
My Focus is picking up some kind of signal.

4
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,000
Maybe I could scan it.

5
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,924
[whistle]

6
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,412
[whistle]

7
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,539
[whistle]

8
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,805
[whistle]

9
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,450
I must be closing in on the signal.

10
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:46,015
[flashback]
A "cauldron". What's that?

11
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,639
[flashback]
Ah, you're from inside the Embrace, so you've never seen one.

12
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,039
[flashback]
A cauldron is a sort of door, I guess.

13
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,253
[flashback]
No one knows what lies beyond.

14
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:00,899
A Cauldron!

15
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,649
There's gotta be a way in, somehow.

16
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,059
Quite a door.

17
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,167
The metal, the light.

18
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,639
It's like this entire place is part of some huge machine.

19
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,958
But who made it?

20
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,092
That thing looks like a triangular pipe.

21
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,942
What's it for?

22
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,683
That might give me some cover if I need it.

23
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,309
Those things are moving components around.

24
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,180
I wonder where?

25
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,670
That thing near the gap.

26
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,259
What does it do?

27
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,059
Oh, very helpful.

28
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,065
It looks like those flying machines move components around.

29
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,553
Might be able to take me somewhere.

30
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,660
Might regret this!

31
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,365
That's the heart of it all, it's gotta be.

32
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,936
So how do I get inside?

33
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,049
I've gone as far as this thing will take me.

34
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,779
You're down, the others haven't noticed.

35
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:30,508
Almost to the heart.

36
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,750
Need them soon enough.

37
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,139
This is how machines are made.

38
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:47,929
Woven out of light.

39
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,150
There are signals coming from all over the place.

40
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,409
That machine's not gonna let me tinker with this stuff.

41
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:14,929
Information about different machines.

42
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,079
This will help me override them!

43
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:27,170
So machines are built in places like this.

44
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:29,171
But why?
