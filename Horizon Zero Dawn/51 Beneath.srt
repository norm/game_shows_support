1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,859
VANASHA: Remember Itamen and Nasadi,
the child-king and his mother, guarded like hostages at Sunfall?

2
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,228
VANASHA: With Bahavas gone, no-one will be watching them.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,129
I want to get them out, and I could use your help.

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,850
Kidnapping the Sun-King of the Shadow Carja is no small task.

5
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,340
It's not kidnapping. They want to go to Meridian, to safety.

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,850
How do you know that?

7
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,399
I've been posing as Nasadi's handmaiden.

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,250
She's scared. For herself, of course, but mostly for Itamen.

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,520
Why do you care what happens to them?

10
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,469
Itamen is the Shadow Carja's figurehead.

11
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,600
If he defects, it will remove their last trace of legitimacy.

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,998
Beyond that, he's just a boy who clings to his mommy.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,134
What do you need to get Nasadi and Itamen out of Sunfall?

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,815
Sunfall is the easy part, I'll handle that.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,709
The big fuss will be crossing the border to the Sundom.

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,369
Find my friend Three-Toed Huavid near the Branded Shore.

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,079
I hired his crew to sweep the path, so all you have to do is wait for me.

18
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,590
You're Three-Toed Huadiv right? Vanasha sent me. What happened?

19
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,811
I got hornswoggled, that's what.

20
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:54,189
Vanasha batted her lashes, wiggled her hips, and promised us treasure.

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,759
"Clear a path for the royals," she said.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,950
"Sneak past the garrison and skewer a few Watchers, hardly a bother."

23
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,400
Little did we know there was a damned monstrosity lurking underground.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
When will I learn not to gawk at skinny girls?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
Why do you think Vanasha swindled you?

26
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,449
My crew came to Sunfall because we heard the bounties were fat.

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,409
She offered us the fattest one of all, enough to retire on.

28
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,668
Find the best path to the lake, make sure it's safe.

29
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,470
What could go wrong? Turns out a lot!

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,418
Like bloody murder in the grinding jaws of a heinous death beast!

31
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,368
I wondered why the Shadow Carja didn't pay attention to the pass.

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,020
Well, they don't need to, a rock eating demon guards it for them.

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,099
It tunnels in the dirt, breaks through the earth,
and blast rocks from it's stinking face!

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,944
I barely escaped, my comrades weren't so lucky.

35
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:56,250
I might shed a tear if they weren't all cut-throats and cheaters.

36
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,560
Vanasha will be here soon with Nasadi and Itamen.

37
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,334
I've got to destroy that thing in the pass before they arrive.

38
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,180
You're not too bright, are you?

39
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:12,300
Well, we didn't last long against it but I'll tell you what I know.

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,090
It has armour everywhere, a little less at the rear.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,000
And when it goes underground, it will lose track of you if you're quiet.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,270
I need to get going.

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,389
I promise to look solemn at your funeral before I hit the bar.

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,719
I'll tuck that away.

45
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Then we do it the hard way.

46
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,670
It felt that!

47
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,950
Saving these for the trail.

48
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,000
By the radiant Sun, I can't believe it!

49
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,450
HUADIV: I thought that evil rock chewer would grind you up.

50
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,203
After that miracle, all we can do is wait.

51
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:37,250
HUADIV: Vanasha will be here soon, along with a boat that will take the royals across the lake.

52
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,789
Ah, little huntress, glad you accepted my invitation to play bodyguard.

53
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,442
VANASHA: Where are your men Huadiv?

54
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,369
It looks like something chewed you up and spat you out.

55
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,629
That's pretty much exactly what happened.

56
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,639
The way is clear. Can we go?

57
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,350
VANASHA: I like how you always cut to the chase, in this case literally.

58
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,649
VANASHA: It won't be long before we're followed.

59
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:17,826
Don't be afraid, your radiance. We've got excellent protection.

60
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,200
VANASHA: Oh, dear. Here come the Shadow Carja and they're very angry with me.

61
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,549
ALOY: I'll hold them off!

62
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,320
Very noble of you but when I started fuss, I like to finish it.

63
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,409
Not that your assistance isn't welcome.

64
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,360
VANASHA: Huadiv, get Itamen and his mother to the shore, carefully.

65
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,399
VANASHA: So it comes to this.

66
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,309
VANASHA: I must say, after two years
under the heel of these zealots, I'm ready to extract a little blood.

67
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,899
VANASHA: Some traps would be nice.

68
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:18,450
VANASHA: Damn, just missed!

69
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,018
VANASHA: Let's try something new, shall we?

70
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,009
VANASHA: Well, that was entertaining, but I suspect we're not done.

71
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,559
VANASHA: More of the bastards, get ready.

72
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,450
VANASHA: Well now, seems I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

73
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:34,297
VANASHA: I don't want to jinx it, but we might be in the clear.

74
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,890
VANASHA: A bit late aren't we gentlemen?

75
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,440
CARJA GUARD: Sorry, ma'am, the boat— [roaring]

76
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,229
VANASHA: Damn, I spoke too soon.

77
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,455
ALOY: This one's mine. Get to the boat.

78
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,720
You know, this time I think I might be out of my league.

79
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,349
If anything happens to her, I will be very cross.

80
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,930
CARJA GUARD: We're not going anywhere.

81
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:12,190
CARJA GUARD: Oh no!

82
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,707
ALOY: Try me now!

83
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:00,939
ALOY: She went that-a-way!

84
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,039
VANASHA: Not exactly a royal barge, is it?

85
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,868
VANASHA: Ah well, defectors can't be choosers.

86
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,599
VANASHA: Let's get aboard, shall we?

87
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,681
VANASHA: You've done a good thing, maybe even ended a war.

88
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:21,718
ALOY: Maybe. But my war just keeps going.

89
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,640
Itamen, my brother, welcome home. You have nothing to fear.

90
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,109
AVAD: You are now under the protection of the Sundom, my protection.

91
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,225
AVAD: As is your mother.
She will not be harmed, you have my word, the law of the Sun.

92
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,007
Aloy. It seems I see your influence everywhere.

93
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,449
You've done so much for the Sundom and it will always be appreciated.

94
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,033
AVAD: You have my thanks. May you walk in the light.

95
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,558
VANASHA: Appalling.

96
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,160
I spent two years in the Forbidden West
setting this up and the redhead gets all the credit?

97
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,690
I'm still getting paid, right?

98
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,289
You'll be lucky if I let you live.

99
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,709
I couldn't have done this without you.

100
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,704
When we meet again, I'll give you a proper thanks, I promise.

101
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,515
MERCHANT: Don't pass up these goods!

102
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,349
MERCHANT: Fine goods for a fair price.

103
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,539
CARJA: You wouldn't believe–

104
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,441
MERCHANT: It won't cost you a shard just to look.

105
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,349
MERCHANT: Don't pass up these goods.

106
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:57,431
MERCHANT: Take a look at these wares.
GUARD: Damn Oseram stirring up tensions. I'm keeping my eyes open.

107
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:31,239
CARJA: I keep thinking about my sister in the Sundom—

108
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,241
CARJA: Ah, I've had enough of work.

109
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,019
GUARD: It's always the ones you least expect that cause you trouble.

110
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:49,740
CARJA: …last night, so it's good to just take a breather.

111
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,087
CARJA: I'm a guard, not the town crier.

112
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:33,786
MERCHANT: You'll regret not stopping when—

113
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:44,414
NOBLE: Is that really all you have? It won't do at all.

114
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,171
MERCHANT: Buy what you need, leave the rest.

115
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,582
MERCHANT: You'll regret not stopping–

116
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,198
TALANAH: Hawk Bradavin Khane Padish, cherished brother.

117
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,299
TALANAH: And Sunhawk Talavad Khane Padish, beloved father.

118
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:17,480
TALANAH: Let their memory and sacrifice
be a beacon for all hunters, all people, to follow.

119
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:43,887
Look, a memorial to my father and brother, and all the men who died in the Sun-Ring.

120
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,039
You made this possible Aloy. Thank you.

121
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,710
What was that prayer you were saying when I first came in? I didn't hear all of it.

122
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,222
O Great Sun, make treaty with the moon to give our fallen quiet rest.

123
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,349
Furnish them with the armour of your brazen heat.

124
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,160
Give them shafts of sunlight for spears.

125
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,599
Illuminate the path to the skies for each one of them.

126
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,569
Hawk Gravid Khane Morza.

127
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:19,690
Hawk Sirav Khane Pir.

128
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,299
Hawk Yusalin Khane Jageer.

129
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,506
Hawk Khulasiv Khane Sovaliy.

130
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,727
Hawk Bradavin Khane Padish, cherished brother.

131
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:37,349
And Sunhawk Talavad Khane Padish, beloved father.

132
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,734
Let their memory and sacrifice be a beacon for all hunters, all people to follow.

133
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:48,119
What happens now in the lodge?

134
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:54,000
As Sunhawk I've made sure we invite
prospective members based on ability and drive.

135
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,022
Regardless of Carja blood.

136
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,549
This lodge will be a stale bastion of the old regime no longer.

137
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:04,480
So what's it like to be Sunhawk?

138
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,914
It feels like sunrise after a long night.

139
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,789
I'm in your debt.

140
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,450
You'll always have a special home here, if you want it.

141
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,736
Well, congratulations Talanah. I should get going.

142
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:23,023
Thank you Aloy Despite the Nora.

143
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,827
[laughs]

144
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,460
May you always take your prey.

145
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,980
CARJA: Spies have released Prince Itamen from Sunfall!

146
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,021
MERCHANT: These aren't goods, they're necessities!

147
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,167
MERCHANT: You'll regret not stopping—

148
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:59,101
CARJA: Dervahl should die for his crimes.
MERCHANT: Buy what you need, leave the rest.

149
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,448
CARJA: You delivered the Prince from out of the hands—

150
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,556
MERCHANT: Buy what you need, leave the rest.

151
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,238
GUARD: There are no shadows under the noonday sun. Words to live by.

152
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,921
GUARD: My poor feet!

153
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,190
CARJA: Those crazy Oseram tried to kill our Sun-King,
until the machine rider stopped them cold.

154
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,849
CARJA: It's a bit, uh, frivolous, isn't it?

155
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,159
CARJA: I prefer the one about the Sun-Priest
falling in love with a merchant's daughter.

156
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,489
CARJA: I love this bit!

157
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,210
It's you! The one who saved Meridian from that Oseram lunatic!

158
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,808
Damned if you aren't a ray of sun on a dark day.

159
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,234
Would you help me?

160
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,599
If I can, what happened?

161
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,001
Mass murder that's what!

162
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,690
Five night guards shredded like cabbage out there in the quarry.

163
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,434
Five men murdered, how?

164
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,900
Don't know. One was a buddy from before the liberation.

165
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,800
We worked this quarry together as slaves for the mad King.

166
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,320
My friend, may he walk forever in the light, knew how to fight.

167
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:33,050
Fiends who do this must have had stealth or numbers.

168
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,838
Could machines have killed them?

169
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,467
Don't see how, the quarry is fenced and gated,
and I've never seen a Glinthawk do anything like this.

170
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:43,780
Anything strike you as strange or out of the ordinary?

171
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:45,512
Well, let's see, uh…

172
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:48,967
Oh, yeah! Chunks of corpses gushing blood.

173
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:56,508
Sorry, pressure's getting to me. Not used to murder. Nah, nothing unusual.

174
00:35:56,508 --> 00:36:01,512
Well, except, we've been doing a little blasting lately and Saravad said…

175
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,134
…naw, that's just stupid.

176
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,400
What exactly did Saravad say?

177
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,698
Ah nothing, kept babbling about a pile of rocks out there.

178
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:11,828
Said he didn't remember it from yesterday.

179
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:16,318
I told him that this here is a quarry where we move rocks all day.

180
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,834
So rocks getting moved ain't so surprising, lunkhead.

181
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,791
You've been using explosives?

182
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:24,658
Sure, to clear away bedrock and get to the good stuff.

183
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:29,048
We do it for a week or so every year, but that's got nothing to do with the dead.

184
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,650
They were torn apart, not blown up.

185
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,739
I know what killed those men.

186
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,808
A machine that attacks from underground.

187
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,780
It's called a Rockbreaker.

188
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,269
Powerful sounds can attract them.

189
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:45,434
Great. What in the name of the Sun am I supposed to do about that?

190
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,434
Just sit tight. This kind of thing is my specialty.

191
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,739
CARJA: Waste of time, show was better last week.

192
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,098
CARJA: Oh, you're in for a treat, it's quite a show.

193
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,000
Explosives, quarry's been doing a lot of blasting.

194
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,239
That doesn't look like an ordinary rock pile.

195
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:40,303
Saw me, here we go.

196
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,667
I just gotta tough the storm out.

197
00:43:56,344 --> 00:43:58,719
CARJA: Oh, wonderful.

198
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,809
CARJA: This isn't up to their usual standard.

199
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:18,093
I've never seen a machine like that, whoa, nor a hunter so bold!

200
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:23,636
Take this. It's from the quarry stores,
but no-one's going to argue that you don't deserve it.

201
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,168
May you walk in the light, friend.

202
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:30,562
Especially when dealing with what comes up from the ground.

203
00:44:30,562 --> 00:44:33,230
CARJA: It's a bit frivolous, isn't it?

204
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,190
CARJA: Oh, that's nice. Glad I stopped for a bit.

205
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:51,018
CARJA: My bones are tired, I've been working too damn hard.

206
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:32,099
OUTLANDER: Success!

207
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,269
Need them soon enough.

208
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:42,979
Alright.

209
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:01,726
Took them long enough.

210
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,265
Now they're hunting me.

211
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:35,329
SHADOW CARJA: One day our Sun-King is here, the next he's gone.
It's like some horrible dream.

212
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:40,944
MERCHANT: These aren't goods, they'r—

213
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:48,214
SHADOW CARJA: Nice to have a break, work's been hard lately.

214
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:19,434
SHADOW CARJA: I imagine they hope to poison young Itamen's mind
against his own people. I pray the Sun provides him clarity.

215
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:22,130
SHADOW CARJA: Now Itamen's been snatched away?

216
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,590
SHADOW CARJA: Move along.

217
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:48,441
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: The balustrade. It's a short drop from there.

218
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:51,111
SYLENS: And you needn't worry about the kestrels.

219
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:53,949
SYLENS: They'll be too busy acting important to pay attention to you.

220
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:00,134
ALOY: You've gotta be kidding.

221
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:01,239
SYLENS: Not at all.

222
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,829
ALOY: This is insane.

223
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,329
SYLENS: Hardly.

224
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:25,337
SYLENS: The other side of the tower, look for a vent.

225
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:37,518
ALOY: I see you've been here before.

226
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,139
SYLENS: Obviously.
