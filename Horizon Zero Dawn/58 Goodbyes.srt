1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,879
I have to tell Avad that the Eclipse are ready to strike.

2
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,561
After what happened with Dervahl, I know he'll defend the city.

3
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,850
But the Spire?

4
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,050
Quick way down.

5
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,750
Save these for the trail.

6
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,149
Pain's drawing back.

7
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,450
Can't be too prepared. 

8
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,609
I can still get the upper hand.

9
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,450
Stay down!

10
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,950
Keep quiet now.

11
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,059
Uhhh maybe I've spent too much time with you.

12
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,549
I can almost feel the lightning in this.

13
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,657
A-a-and the taste, huh?!

14
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:11,659
Metal striking sparks along a sharpening stone, lingering…

15
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,067
Here, touch it to your tongue and—

16
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:18,259
No, that's your thing, not mine.

17
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,108
You look startled, are you okay?

18
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,319
I…

19
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,759
I must leave, you should too.

20
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,569
Without a story? I brought down a Stormbird.

21
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:43,702
You did, you're very able, and you're right, owed is owed.

22
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:51,299
But no more stories of the past, all told, all done.

23
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,710
Future stories.

24
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,609
I saw an onrushing storm.

25
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,759
The future comes hungry, for man and machine.

26
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,067
It will catch me I expect, catch us all.

27
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:14,107
So enough hunts, enough visions.

28
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:19,200
I'll run, chase that teasing sun to the Forbidden West.

29
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,275
I–I don't understand, I mean not that I ever understand, but…

30
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:26,599
Are you saying we should fear what's coming?

31
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:31,077
Ohhh yes! Jungle on fire!

32
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:35,247
Machine blue light dying out in the eddies of ashes.

33
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:42,660
You, fallen, pale as snow-flash, eyes staring open.

34
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,549
The Metal World, but not the one I sought.

35
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,134
The future is a frightful dream, huntress.

36
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:53,600
My name is Aloy.

37
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,647
I grew fond of you, your curiosities and disbeliefs, Aloy.

38
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,460
If you weather this storm, look for me.

39
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,549
I'd like that.

40
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,216
Where? In the west? In the storm?

41
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,767
In dreams, yes.

42
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,630
Those machines are alert.

43
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
They're scanning for me.

44
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,949
Handy.

45
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,690
Stocking up.

46
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,450
Let's see you catch us!

47
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:21,268
Always watching.

48
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,214
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

49
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,010
Those clamps have the armour locked in place.

50
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:06,371
Maybe there's a way to power up the mechanism, release the clamps?

51
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,449
Only two more.

52
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,599
Just one more.

53
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:30,444
There we go, the last one.

54
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,200
All powered up. Now to get the dials in position.

55
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:41,150
These numbers, they must be related to segments of a circle.

56
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:11,947
Did it.

57
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:14,449
Let's have a look at that armour inside.

58
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,989
Alright, now let's see what we can do with this material.

59
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:06,429
Save that for later.

60
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,400
Hi Rost.

61
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,184
A lot has happened.

62
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:28,170
So I… I went inside the mountain.

63
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:30,929
Do you remember the night before the Proving?

64
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,090
The final lesson you taught me?

65
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:38,694
You said I needed to serve a purpose bigger than myself.

66
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:43,834
Well, it couldn't get much bigger.

67
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,491
It's the same purpose that drove Elisabet and Gaia.

68
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:53,100
One they were willing to die for.

69
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,150
So yeah, I'll do it.

70
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,699
Give myself to that, for Elisabet, and Gaia, and for you.

71
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:07,349
I've got what I need to destroy Hades.

72
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,958
The master override.

73
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,500
Now all I have to do is drive it into Hades' skull, so no problem there.

74
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,690
The final battle will be fought at Meridian.

75
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,989
Hades will come for the Spire and I'll be ready.

76
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,340
I found out how Elisabet died.

77
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,167
She sacrificed herself, as you might expect.

78
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:34,663
Said something about going home.

79
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,599
I wonder where that was for her.

80
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:45,726
If I ever find out, I'd like to go there, see it myself.

81
00:47:45,726 --> 00:47:49,970
Assuming I actually survive the battle at Meridian, of course.

82
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:56,634
Which, let's face it, is… well, who knows?

83
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,505
Well, I'll um, try to come back if I can, but…

84
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:08,479
I guess this…

85
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:11,767
This might be it.

86
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,314
Thank you, Rost.

87
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:21,889
Thank you for everything.

88
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Now they're hunting me.

89
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,593
Getting soaked from melted snow.

90
00:57:57,259 --> 00:57:59,259
Low and quiet does it.
