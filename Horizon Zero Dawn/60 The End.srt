1
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:45,950
How could you sleep Elisabet, with a weight like this pressing on you?

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,240
How did you Rost, after you lost your family?

3
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:58,899
Sylens? Are you there?

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,084
Guess I shouldn't ask ghosts for advice.

5
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,310
GUARD: Ma'am, there are signs from the West.

6
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,421
GUARD: Sun-King Avad awaits you at the Temple of the Sun.

7
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:57,093
Campfires, perhaps? Massing forces for the long march to the city gates?

8
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,722
ALOY: That's not wood smoke.

9
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,356
Then what is it?

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,799
The end.

11
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,450
Or how it begins anyway.

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,878
The Deathbringers you spoke of?

13
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:40,000
To the guns!

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,390
ALOY: TO THE GUNS!

15
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,620
ALOY: NOW!

16
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,833
AVAD: By the Sun, do as she says!

17
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,742
OSERAM: Set and loaded!

18
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,679
OSERAM: All of you be ready to fire.

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,669
AVAD: Will the guns hold them back?

20
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,084
ALOY: We're about to find out.

21
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,050
AVAD: Helis!

22
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,138
ALOY: No!

23
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,587
ALOY: Rally the Vanguard, send reinforcements.

24
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,266
AVAD: Aloy, no!

25
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,210
ALOY: We need those guns!

26
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,889
AVAD: He will cut you down!

27
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,349
ALOY: Not this time!

28
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,951
ECLIPSE: On me!

29
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:36,419
HELIS: You have vexed me long enough.

30
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,905
ALOY: Should have found me in the Sun-Ring then!

31
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,229
HELIS: Why do you fight?

32
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,898
HELIS: The end is inevitable.

33
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:12,330
HELIS: Accept it, accept your weakness.

34
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,186
HELIS: Only endless night awaits you.

35
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,616
HELIS: Meridian must run red to be cleansed.

36
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,862
ALOY: He's too dangerous in close.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,259
ALOY: If the Deathbringers keep firing, this bridge will go.

38
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,850
ALOY: Bridge can't take much more of this.

39
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,267
ALOY: He's quick.

40
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,750
ALOY: It's giving way!

41
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,930
HELIS: What are you before the Terror of the Sun?

42
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,115
HELIS: Impossible!

43
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:44,264
HELIS: I'm chosen. This was not meant to be.

44
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,994
None of this was meant to be, Helis.

45
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,498
You made it happen.

46
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:53,621
Followed your orders, butchered so many, and for what?

47
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:59,300
To die on your knees, used like a pawn by a power you don't even understand?

48
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,306
You pity me?

49
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,500
Turn your face to the sun.

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,295
VANGUARD: For Meridian! Hold the line!

51
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,497
ALOY: Where do you need me?

52
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,313
VANGUARD: Take up a cannon, on the platforms.

53
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,207
VANGUARD: Machines from the west!

54
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,538
VANGUARD: South! They're coming from the south!

55
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,220
ALOY: Gotta get to another platform.

56
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,145
VANGUARD: Look to the west!

57
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,013
VANGUARD: It fires on you, Nora!

58
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,763
VANGUARD: Take cover from the Deathbringer!

59
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,450
VANGUARD: No signs, a lull in the attack.

60
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,268
VANGUARD: Lower your arms, but be wary!

61
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,659
ALOY: A chance to catch a breath and prepare.

62
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,643
VANGUARD: Raise arms again! West!

63
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:42,750
ALOY: And now it's mad. Time to go!

64
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,793
VANGUARD: From the sky!

65
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,717
ALOY: It felt that!

66
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:19,290
VANGUARD: By the Sun! All shadows descend on us!

67
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,000
ALOY: The Corruption again! [coughs]

68
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:58,000
VANGUARD: Stormbird! STORMBIRD!

69
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ALOY: It's taking a shot at me!

70
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,000
ALOY: Yes!

71
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,969
ALOY: Incoming!

72
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,151
TEB: Aloy.

73
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,170
TEB: Aloy!

74
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,060
TEB: ALOY!

75
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:06,483
ALOY: Teb?

76
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,809
TEB: By All-Mother, you survive.

77
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,490
TEB: I thought you were killed.

78
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,266
ALOY: The others are they…?

79
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,530
TEB: No! No, wounded but alive, mostly.

80
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,509
TEB: The machines blasted through, then kept going.

81
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:23,038
TEB: They marched on the Spire, dragging that thing with them.

82
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,264
ALOY: Take care of the others, Teb. I've gotta go.

83
00:15:52,159 --> 00:16:00,429
[screams]

84
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,072
ALOY: Gotta press on.

85
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:26,392
NIL: This is where I belong, Aloy, but the Spire calls for you!

86
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,126
UTHID: Take the fight to the Spire, Aloy.

87
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:39,720
UTHID: Meridian will hold or my marks of honour mean nothing.

88
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,218
NIL: To think I almost missed this, but where you must go now, I can't follow.

89
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,200
GUARD: The Sun never fails.

90
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,984
ALUKI: Cursed machines!

91
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,089
ALUKI: I will answer your challenge!

92
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,949
ALUKI: My strength is not yet spent, I earned it by ice and snow!

93
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,259
It's begun.

94
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,720
Hades is transmitting!

95
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:20,069
If Hades has started the signal, it must have gotten through the defences!

96
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:26,145
The Nora, Erend's Vanguard, I have to get up there!

97
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,325
Gotta keep going, keep pushing.

98
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,000
Knew this wouldn't be easy.

99
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,259
So no holding back!

100
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,140
Oh, they're alive!

101
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,348
Aloy!

102
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,519
It's Aloy!

103
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,829
Well, you-you can see that.

104
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,450
We thought you'd fallen at the ridge.

105
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,789
No, the ridge fell on me.

106
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,439
Look, there isn't a lot of time left.

107
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,306
I have to face Hades!

108
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,619
Not alone.

109
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,847
It's my fight, I can't ask you to come with me.

110
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,420
We're about to go over the top anyway, right?

111
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:32,430
Right!

112
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,638
Hawk and Thrush, let's go.

113
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,049
ALOY: War Chief Sona.

114
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,328
SONA: Go on.

115
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:43,269
SONA: I will live.

116
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,398
HADES: Arrival of entity has been anticipated.

117
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:14,799
HADES: Entity will not halt transmission.

118
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,523
HADES: To contrary, calculations are precise.

119
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:28,839
HADES: Presence of entity has been accounted for.

120
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,604
TALANAH: Is that a Deathbringer?

121
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,259
TALANAH: Hunt's not done yet, more machines!

122
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,979
ALOY: All of you, focus on the new machines!

123
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:50,756
ALOY: We've taken out the Corrupted!

124
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:53,970
TALANAH: We still stand and they do not!

125
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:38,756
ALOY: Time enough to beat the machines back…

126
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:54,381
VARL: Watch it, Aloy, more machines!

127
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,312
ALOY: Take them out first!

128
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,732
ALOY: We got them!

129
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:45,269
TALANAH: They are slain, our arrows were true!

130
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:05,064
ALOY: We've got time, okay, still got time.

131
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:17,660
ALOY: That's it! My way is clear.

132
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,888
TALANAH: Finish it, Aloy! Finish it now!

133
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,509
HADES: System threat imminent.

134
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:23,248
ALOY: I'm more than a threat!

135
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,376
COMPUTER: Master override armed.

136
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:58,067
COMPUTER: To activate, state name and rank.

137
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:02,876
ALOY: Elisabet Sobeck, Alpha Prime.

138
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,606
COMPUTER: Master override activated, purging extinction protocol.

139
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,266
ELISABET SOBECK: Okay, Gaia, uh, sorry about that. Where was I?

140
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,400
GAIA: You were telling a story.

141
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,620
ELISABET SOBECK: Right, yeah, so um, like I was saying.

142
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,781
ELISABET SOBECK: It was a children's electronics kit,
but I'd hacked the wiring to an auto battery and solar PV.

143
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:45,317
ELISABET SOBECK: So the grass caught fire, and uh, so did a tall pine
that'd stood there, I don't know, maybe a hundred years.

144
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:48,319
GAIA: Query: You were how old?

145
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,369
ELISABET SOBECK: Six.

146
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,019
ELISABET SOBECK: My mother was home, thank God.

147
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:54,409
ELISABET SOBECK: So she called the fire department.

148
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,611
ELISABET SOBECK: And after she took me out to the lawn
and showed me the dead baby birds.

149
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:02,199
ELISABET SOBECK: Because there were nests in the pine tree.

150
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,554
GAIA: Query: What did you feel?

151
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,519
ELISABET SOBECK: I'm not sure?

152
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,779
ELISABET SOBECK: I remember yelling that I didn't care.

153
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,573
ELISABET SOBECK: And that's when my mother
took my face in her hands and spoke.

154
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,559
GAIA: Query: What did she say?

155
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,970
ELISABET SOBECK: She said I had to care.

156
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,862
ELISABET SOBECK: She said,
"Elisabet, being smart will count for nothing if you don't make the world better."

157
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:34,740
ELISABET SOBECK: "You have to use your smarts to count for something."

158
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,539
ELISABET SOBECK: "To serve life, not death."

159
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,420
GAIA: You often tell stories of your mother, but you are childless.

160
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:47,920
ELISABET SOBECK: I never had time.

161
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,980
ELISABET SOBECK: Guess it was for the best.

162
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,160
GAIA: If you had had a child, Elisabet,
what would you have wished for him or her?

163
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:07,711
ELISABET SOBECK: I guess I would have wanted her to be curious.

164
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,480
ELISABET SOBECK: And wilful, unstoppable even.

165
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:21,916
ELISABET SOBECK: But with enough compassion
to heal the world, just a little bit.

166
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,663
ELISABET SOBECK: Anyway, that's all I've got for now, Gaia.

167
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,684
ELISABET SOBECK: Time to tuck in.

168
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,549
GAIA: I wish you a pleasant sleep, Elisabet.

169
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,243
ELISABET SOBECK: Thank you. I'll catch you tomorrow.

170
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,170
Hello, old friend.

171
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,590
Remember me?

172
