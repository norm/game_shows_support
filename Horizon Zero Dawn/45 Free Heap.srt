1
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,650
Keep quiet now.

2
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,360
That's it, I'm already gone.

3
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,665
CARJA OUTLANDER: By the Sun, I'm alive! Thank you, Nora.

4
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,650
CARJA OUTLANDER: You, please, can we talk?

5
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,250
ALOY: This will do nicely.

6
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,392
CARJA OUTLANDER: You saved me. Will you accept this as thanks?

7
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,184
Calm, calm.

8
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,750
CARJA OUTLANDER: Follow me!

9
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,300
OSERAM: Carja may like this heat but I sure don't.
ALOY: They must be Oseram.

10
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,910
ALOY: They've put their stamp on this place.

11
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,740
OSERAM: Thinking about heading back to The Claim.

12
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:27,048
OSERAM: Look, I've got a pair of sturdy Oseram hands,
and I know how to put them to use. There'll always be work for me.

13
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,920
ALOY: Someone over there?

14
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,199
Well, well.

15
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,589
Always told Dervahl a woman would undo him, and he had it coming.

16
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,089
Ha! I've calluses older than you.

17
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,052
I have calluses enough if you wanna test me.

18
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,369
Ha, she sparks!

19
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,000
I believe it, flamehair.

20
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,310
Petra Forgewoman.

21
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,750
Aaah, Aloy … machine hunter.

22
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,125
Mmm, machine hunter, eh?

23
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,091
Huh, I could have a use for you.

24
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:13,453
Straight of it is we're being muscled out of our own claim.

25
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,559
That's why I've been working on this scrap-spitting beast.

26
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,259
It's a dispute settler.

27
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,350
I've never seen anything like it.

28
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,579
Your design?

29
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,889
Mmm, see my face in it, can you?

30
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,064
This one's mother helped reclaim Meridian back in the day.

31
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:29,660
A job like that isn't done with strategy.

32
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:35,000
They needed to shake the walls,
turn the Mad Sun King's army to blood and feathers.

33
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,934
What's that face for?

34
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,049
Weapons with such power.

35
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,889
It's not the weapon, flamehair, it's the wielder.

36
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,120
If that siege had touched the great elevator, they'd have answered to me.

37
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,418
Good work, that elevator. Story in every chain link.

38
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,690
I'll make you suffer them one day, if you like.

39
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,950
This beast doesn't have a story yet.

40
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,147
Too heavy to carry, eats metal like a Snapmaw.

41
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,279
What is this place, Petra?

42
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,763
The Free Heap.

43
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:09,413
Free, because we answer to no-one but ourselves,
the metal, and the dust storms.

44
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:10,969
And the heap's back there.

45
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,538
A scrapyard, piled by Oseram past from the leavings of the Old Ones.

46
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,387
Breathe it in, get the smell in you.

47
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:21,070
Smoke, and sweat.

48
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,509
Living in the trees has dulled your senses.

49
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:27,266
I could taste five medals just in my spit.

50
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:31,450
So all this scrap was left by the ancients. Was it a battlefield?

51
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,889
Mmm, stockpile maybe, or a rubbish heap.

52
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,200
Packed so tight it all fused together.

53
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,289
Those Old Ones tossed away more than we'll ever know.

54
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,739
But don't you want to know? To understand what it all meant?

55
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,339
Nah. Some delvers spend their whole lives trying to make sense of it, not me.

56
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,229
What it means is there's good smelting here.

57
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,634
Yeah, don't need to understand a forest to chop down the trees for your arrows.

58
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,580
If you did, you'd know Ridge-Wood makes better shafts.

59
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,789
Oh, careful, you'll scald your tongue with that fire.

60
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,709
I don't pine for the Old Ones.

61
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,289
They had their time, their works are finished.

62
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,879
All their inventions are under mountains now, rust on bones.

63
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,649
My sisters and brothers of the forge will make a new world.

64
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,009
You run the forge and the town too?

65
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,554
The town is the forge! And everyone pulls their weight.

66
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,299
The right way to do it, without all the ealdormen having their say.

67
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,834
If we were back in The Claim — Oseram land — 
three days argument any time someone wants to hammer in a bolt.

68
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,309
Sounds infuriating.

69
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,869
Oh, it is. But we like arguing.

70
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,399
You need hot air to keep a furnace burning.

71
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,549
Still, some traditions aren't up for debate.

72
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,651
I would have ended up "Petra Forgewife".

73
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:47,289
How'd you like the sound of that?

74
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,990
[laughs] I don't think it fits you.

75
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,600
Good answer.

76
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,168
That's why I left.

77
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,257
I was steel-young from the forge then.

78
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:58,839
Could make anything of myself before I cooled in my ways.

79
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,250
So you left your homeland and came here?

80
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,429
Went to Meridian, everyone does.

81
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,788
Joined the work gangs on the great elevator.

82
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:09,048
We finished just as the Mad King got a taste for blood.

83
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:13,099
So I spat and swore I'd find a place for everyone who stuck with me.

84
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,590
We lived job to job until the war ended.

85
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,189
Then we came upon this old Oseram camp.

86
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,791
Long abandoned, metal piled up high.

87
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,383
A place to start again, a place to leave my mark.

88
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:29,620
Ha, when I was your age, I thought the lasting mark came from the hardest strike.

89
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,299
I suppose you know better now that you're an elder?

90
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,918
Ha, trade secret.

91
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,325
You said you're being pushed out of your territory?

92
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:39,079
Out of the junk heap.

93
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,439
A pack of Scrappers came snuffling in
just after we opened a good seam of weapon parts.

94
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,928
And now we've got a standoff with a gang of bandits at our foundry.

95
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:49,419
They blockaded us out.

96
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,549
They're sitting on our power cells.

97
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,839
Guess they like shiny things.

98
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,515
Well, to finish up our defences, I need those parts and cells.

99
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:01,349
In and out job, keep your hands clean.

100
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,379
I'm not afraid of getting them dirty.

101
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,769
Ha! Aren't you a blast of air from the bellows!

102
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,000
OSERAM: … like it … there's a man who knows how to …

103
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,940
OSERAM: The longer we stay here, the more it'll feel like home.

104
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,880
OSERAM: Is it just me or do the Carja people walk slow?
Don't they have places to be?

105
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,169
OSERAM: Aren't you a sight!

106
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:28,631
BANDIT: If I had right of rule, I'd have taken the town first.
More slaves for digging up lightning boxes.

107
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,894
BANDIT: Then make your claim for it when the others get here.
Won't be long now.

108
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,470
BANDIT: Whoa!

109
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,279
ALOY: All this scrap, dragged here from who knows where and when.

110
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,934
BANDIT: They're gonna wipe us out!

111
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:28,396
BANDIT: If we don't rally, we're scrap.

112
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,862
ALOY: Alright.

113
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,809
ALOY: Bandits have a good defence.

114
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,934
ALOY: Better spot all their sentrys before I look for the power cells.

115
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,769
There, a power cell.

116
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:09,019
Okay, done. Now to get into the Scrappers run and find those weapon parts.

117
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,424
You'll get yours when the clan blows in, town's good as torched.

118
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Okay.

119
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,349
Lots of Scrappers prowling, hope they haven't stripped the parts already.

120
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,265
The Scrappers made that pile.

121
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:53,069
Strange, are they nesting?

122
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:56,093
Now let me find something Petra can use, fast!

123
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,660
Oh, mine now!

124
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,573
Back to Petra, I've been in this scrap yard long enough.

125
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:32,058
Petra, I have the parts you wanted but there are more bandits coming.

126
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:35,220
The rest of their clan, they want to take the town.

127
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,739
Do they now? Hold this thing steady while I give it a voice.

128
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,960
Then we'll let it talk terms for us.

129
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,329
Now take it up and brace yourself.

130
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,351
Don't press it against your hips if you ever want to use those for…

131
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,468
Alright, alright, I got it.

132
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:53,160
ALOY: Heavy, all I can do to hold it up.

133
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:56,062
ALOY: Come on, then, if you're coming!

134
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,527
BANDIT: Run this forgedirt town red, boys!

135
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,950
PETRA: Heh, manners!

136
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:09,710
BANDIT: At 'em, boys!
PETRA: Haha, she's working well so far!

137
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:27,211
PETRA: Room for improvement on the gun, no complaints about the gunner.

138
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,097
PETRA: Haha, anyone but a bandit clan would pull back now.

139
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:57,875
BANDIT: Come on, you bungheads, they only have one cannon!

140
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:40,514
PETRA: They're gathering under the bridge, Aloy, bring it down on 'em.

141
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:42,234
ALOY: What? It's your bridge.

142
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,594
PETRA: Bridges come and go, shoot it down.

143
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,198
ALOY: Oh boy.

144
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:51,407
PETRA: Whoa! Might have overdone it a little.

145
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,178
PETRA: Now I'm no soldier, but I'd call that a rout.

146
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:15,193
Oh, my teeth hurt from all that.

147
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:19,334
That's interesting. Need a leather strap to bite down on, perhaps.

148
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:21,833
We'll give those wretches a sky burial.

149
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,653
That's fancy talk for leaving them out for the birds.

150
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,982
More than they'd done for us if this thing didn't work.

151
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,500
Uh, if it didn't work? It could have not worked?!

152
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,371
It isn't finished, that's why we're testing it.

153
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,674
Now, now, you had your Nora toys to fight with.

154
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:41,367
Saying goes, "You can only trust metal."

155
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:44,067
But my trust was placed well in you.

156
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:47,919
You're owed Aloy Machinehunter. I won't forget it.

157
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,999
And neither will I, Petra.

158
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:55,160
ALOY: Whoa, still feel the lightning snap in my hair.

159
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:39,629
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me,

160
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:44,139
Up and go!

161
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,942
Damn dust, ugh!

162
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:38,380
Whoa, there.

163
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:02,928
I hunted that Thunderjaw you asked for.

164
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,434
I should be the one telling a story this time.

165
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:10,870
You carry it with you! Beamwire, burns, and bruises.

166
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,276
The salt lines of your sweat.

167
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:17,929
See, on your skin? Tiny metal flakes!

168
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,280
You mean it was a hard fight? How perceptive.

169
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,230
What signs you've shown me, huntress.

170
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,288
But now, the blood.

171
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,897
I followed red trails through a green world.

172
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:41,550
Thunderjaw, striding with the majesty of an old god.

173
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,039
These wicked parts, fashioned to kill men.

174
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,260
This great whole, made to haunt the sleep of children.

175
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:56,320
And I realise it is a young beast.

176
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,610
It was not there to see the first strange birds roost upon a metal skull.

177
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,700
It became because of us!

178
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,778
Hunters. I saw many, of tribes gone and yet to come.

179
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,534
I even saw you there, fiery haired, fierce, bared… 

180
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,795
What?

181
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:18,909
…bared of metal, huntress.

182
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,936
Bared of what we tore from their hides to be strong like them, savage like them.

183
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:30,670
We build our world in the machine's shadow,
called them out with every strike of rock and hammer.

184
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:37,670
You think something — some machine — made the Thunderjaw because of us?

185
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:44,088
When you've tasted what I have, in the blood there's change.

186
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,358
Such a change!

187
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,203
It's colder than Ban-Ur, hotter than the Carja Sun!

188
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,190
Does any machine walk or crawl that you haven't drunk from?

189
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:00,038
In the mountains north, the Stormbirds.

190
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,762
Even the air in their passing crackles with potency!

191
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:07,615
In the sweep of their eyes, they see all.

192
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:10,519
Don't get too excited.

193
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,034
I'll get the Stormbird blood … maybe, we'll see.

194
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:23,719
They must know how the orbit slows,
fades, falls, decays, and yet returns to more than zero.

195
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,453
Yeah, uh-huh.

196
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,198
You don't fear knowledge.

197
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:30,420
You reach into its flame.

198
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:33,110
It's always an experience with you.

199
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,965
Learn from the machines.

200
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:41,963
Be metal-still, run blood-hot, strike lightning-quick.

201
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,599
Hoping they'd miss me.

202
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,998
Aren't you a little out of your way, Nora?

203
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,429
Your Sacred Lands don't extend this far.

204
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:14,069
I go where I like.
