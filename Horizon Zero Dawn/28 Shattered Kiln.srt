1
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,685
It's off!

2
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,370
Full already.

3
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,049
[Carja guard]
My duty is to guard, I don't get involved in politics.

4
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,724
[Carja guard]
She didn't even hesitate, she stood between the assassin and our Sun-King.

5
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,899
[Carja noble]
My family might still be alive and you're going to stand here and do nothing?

6
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:46,933
[Carja guard]
We've lost a dozen patrols beyond the valley. Our orders are clear, no more.

7
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,440
[Carja guard]
Freeholds were warned.

8
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,059
[Carja noble]
You're talking about orders. I'm talking about lives!

9
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,538
[Carja guard]
That's what the orders are for, to save lives.

10
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,281
[Carja guard]
Good day, citizen.

11
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:59,385
[Carja guard]
Sun bless you for saving the Sun-King.

12
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,149
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods!

13
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,524
[Carja merchant]
Come take a look. I'll give you a good price.

14
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,279
[Carja merchants]
- Buy what you need, leave the rest.
- Look at these wares!

15
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,244
[Carja merchants]
- Buy what you need, leave the rest.
- Won't find better wares!

16
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,540
[Carja merchants]
- Check out these goods.
- You'll regret not stopping when you're in the thick of it.
- I've got all the best goods here.

17
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:22,536
[Carja merchants]
- You'll like what I have for sale, I promise.
- Don't pass up these goods.

18
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,292
[Carja merchants]
- Fine goods for a fair price.
- Check out these wares.

19
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,529
[Carja merchant]
You'll regret not stopping when you're in the thick of it.

20
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,804
[Carja merchants]
- Come take a look.
- You won't find better wares.

21
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,929
[Carja merchant]
Fine goods for a fair price.

22
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,003
[Carja merchant]
Won't cost you a shard just to look.

23
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,531
[Carja merchant]
Only the finest goods here.

24
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:51,389
[Carja outlander]
Dervahl stormed the Palace and still he lives?

25
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,470
[Carja outlander]
I bet those traitorous Oseram will just conveniently move…

26
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,450
[Oseram worker]
I wasn't sure about the Sundom at first, but it's growing on me.

27
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,669
[Fernund]
Oh, no!

28
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:28,068
[Fernund, thumping on locked door]
Let me in, by fire and spit, let me in!

29
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:36,234
Oh Fernund, our deal is off.

30
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,549
Oh it's you.

31
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:39,759
How about a new deal?

32
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,490
You could just cut off my finger, or my hand, or my left arm.

33
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,350
But that's my final offer.

34
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,250
Oh, it won't be enough.

35
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,450
You wouldn't.

36
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,149
Not here, not in front of everyone?

37
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,830
No one's gonna lift a finger to stop me.

38
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,979
You just led a group of men to their deaths, remember?

39
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,549
They were bad men.

40
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,490
I did a service really.

41
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,379
You did.

42
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,750
You did the service.

43
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:06,990
I'll make sure it never happens again.

44
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,649
I'll hold you to it.

45
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,913
Understood. You won't hear from any of us ever again.

46
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,549
I'd better not.

47
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,649
[Carja guard]
It's her, the hero!

48
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,653
[Carja guard]
He's guilty, he should pay!

49
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,059
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday sun…

50
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,009
Just stay out of their way for now.

51
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,181
Now they're hunting me.

52
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:52,624
[whistle]

53
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,194
Maker's End, not much farther now.

54
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,833
Olin said he found an image of the woman I resemble on an ancient device.

55
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:17,279
If she's my mother, why would there be traces of her
all the way out here, so far from Nora land?

56
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,169
I don't get it. Who is she?

57
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,549
[voice from Focus]
Her name is Elisabet Sobeck.

58
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,500
[Aloy]
You! Spying through my Focus again?

59
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,039
[Aloy]
Well, go on, what do you know about her?

60
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:36,034
[voice from Focus]
Stay on your present course and before long

61
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:39,549
[voice from Focus]
you'll know her as well as I do. Maybe better.

62
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,049
[voice from Focus]
But be wary.

63
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,268
[voice from Focus]
Maker's End is crawling with Eclipse troops.

64
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:48,898
[voice from Focus]
To help you deal with them, I've left some useful equipment just outside the ruins.

65
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,489
[voice from Focus]
Your Focus will show the location.

66
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,839
Who is he and how does he know these things?

67
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,160
He said "Elisabet Sobeck".

68
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,190
What kind of name is that?

69
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:26,278
[Nora Brave]
So many dead. We'll all be dead, soon enough.

70
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,349
I saw some of the places you'd been.

71
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,777
The new settlers have no appreciation of craft.

72
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:38,859
They'd already piled your work in a ditch.

73
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,631
But I knew the signs to look for.

74
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:45,400
The scrabble in the dirt, those surprised splashes.

75
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,833
I did tell you we'd meet again.

76
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,950
Nil, still hunting bandits?

77
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,239
Oh yes.

78
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,783
I've been sharpening my blade, anticipating the scent of the fight.

79
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,432
Don't get me wrong, these scum are odorous.

80
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:05,059
A little panic and desperation really sets it off though, like an incense.

81
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,549
So what's your knife called?

82
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,660
Why would someone name a knife?

83
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,660
So much for small talk.

84
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,099
Are you ready?

85
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,349
I didn't need your aid before, and I still don't.

86
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,093
Now that I've seen what you can do, you don't get another camp for free.

87
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,369
Think of this as a friendly competition.

88
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:26,599
Huh, "friendly"?

89
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,918
[Bandit]
Right here, you …

90
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,619
Calm.

91
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:38,619
Ah, better. No more time to recover.

92
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,769
Need to keep my kit dry.

93
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:26,049
They're still looking for me.

94
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,549
[Bandit]
She's up on high.

95
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,289
[Bandit]
Where'd you go?

96
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,193
[Bandit]
We're dead too if you don't fight.

97
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:14,514
[Bandit]
Don't move, I got… ugh!

98
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,638
[Carja villager]
We're letting the Oseram decide what to do with him?

99
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,193
[Carja villager]
But he tried to kill our Sun-King!

100
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:17,422
[Carja guard]
The Oseram that tried to kill our Sun-King? Traitors, the whole tribe of them.

101
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,960
Alright.

102
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,369
[Carja guard]
We will never be able to repay you for the life of our Sun-King.

103
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,746
[Carja villager]
I'll wager Erend is behind Dervahl's extradition.

104
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,352
[Carja villager]
Oseram stick together, after all.

105
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,515
[Carja villager]
How did he get so close to the Sun-King?

106
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:02,208
[Carja villager]
The Oseram guard will be blaming their shadows for their mistakes.

107
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,340
No space.

108
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,434
[Carja villager]
Dervahl tried to kill the Sun-King, unbelievable!

109
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,755
Remember how the blood pounded in your ears?

110
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:49,539
They'll ring later, in the calm.

111
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,836
It's a call to arms from your inner desires.

112
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,820
Or a cry for help.

113
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,388
I wouldn't fight it.

114
00:38:57,389 --> 00:38:59,460
So you used to be a soldier.

115
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,099
You fought for the Carja?

116
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,780
For them, against them, an empire always finds its wars.

117
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,219
You can't be picky.

118
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,908
The new king Avad saw things differently.

119
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,739
Called an investigation into war crimes.

120
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,949
Aren't all wars a crime to someone?

121
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,389
Still, I raised my hand and volunteered.

122
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:21,159
You volunteered to investigate?

123
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,829
No, I volunteered my confession.

124
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,739
No sense wasting time with an investigation.

125
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:31,332
You know of those places, lonely places, where people once were?

126
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,059
Now just a hole cut in the world.

127
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,940
Chances are I was there before.

128
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:41,932
What were these things you did, Nil?

129
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:45,010
Acceptable things under the circumstances.

130
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:47,440
Huh, acceptable to who?

131
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,269
I don't make decisions.

132
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,530
Let's just say the rules of engagement suited me.

133
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,608
But rules are important, a structure, cage.

134
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,250
I was sent to Sunstone Rock for two years.

135
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,019
The trade was fair.

136
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,849
Is this some kind of Carja ritual?

137
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:10,378
Our new Sun-King is a believer in rehabilitation, as am I.

138
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:17,079
In the heat of a stone cell in the dark, I learned to focus on what was truly important to me.

139
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,019
Have you found a new partner yet?

140
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,900
I thought we were partners.

141
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,619
I have my own roads to follow, Nil.

142
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:26,355
And they seem to lead back to bandits.

143
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:29,600
That works for me, I'm not suggesting a Carja wedding.

144
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,170
I'm never lonely where there's killing to be done.

145
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,690
Time to move on.

146
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,732
A brief encounter for us, but the end for them.

147
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:39,667
They were squalid lives anyway.

148
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:51,550
[Carja guard]
You stopped that assassin. Walk in light for your bravery.

149
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,920
[Carja villager]
The Oseram that tried to kill our Sun-King? Traitors, the whole tribe of them.

150
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,719
[Carja villager]
…conveniently moved Dervahl in transport to Mainspring.
