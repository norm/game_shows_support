1
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,359
ARATAK: You saw what she did.

2
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:33,100
ARATAK: She defeated the machines, not I.

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,073
ARATAK: It is proven, she is the better hunter.

4
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,611
ARATAK: We are Banuk. Survive, prevail, what else matters?

5
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:58,280
ARATAK: My blood is in your teeth.

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,156
ARATAK: I take my place behind you on the hunt.

7
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,099
That's got their attention!

8
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,879
Down you go!

9
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,250
Not bad.

10
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,160
Stay down!

11
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,350
These will keep.

12
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,389
Look out below!

13
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,250
I have to kill off these pulses.

14
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,100
Damn wind, never cared for being pushed around.

15
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,850
Here we go again.

16
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,235
Ha!

17
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:56,877
BANUK: We should not pile his Father's guilt onto
the new Carja king's shoulders. These are different times.

18
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,690
BANUK: Your song echoes, friend.

19
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,720
Aloy, right?

20
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,160
My pop, Burgrend, I mean, told me you might be heading up to see me.

21
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,259
Varga, pleasure.

22
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,989
Hey, that spear is really something! You've customised her haven't you?

23
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,329
I've made a change or two. You've got an eye for weapons.

24
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,710
I wish these Banuk agreed with you.

25
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,690
I can't seem to sell scrap to a Glinthawk around here.

26
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,880
Everyone wants boring old bows and spears.

27
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,705
I like the more unusual stuff and the Banuk can get unusual.

28
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:34,922
Like that spear Aratak hauls around, an Icerail!

29
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:39,559
Oooh, or that weapon of Ourea's?
What I wouldn't give to poke around inside one of those.

30
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,939
Feel the lightning on my fingers.

31
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,118
So let's say someone you know happened to have a weapon like Ourea's…

32
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,200
You don't!

33
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,091
See for yourself.

34
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:50,347
VARGA: Of course, look at the…

35
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,789
…so the coils generate the spark, but the power source isn't even bolted in.

36
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,972
I won't lie, she's beautiful.

37
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:01,908
But there's beautiful and then there's BEAUTIFUL.

38
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,616
What we need is a Stormbird talon,
lightning flows over them like water off a goose.

39
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,820
I've got an Icerail, just like Aratak's. You wanna take a look?

40
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,695
Are you serious? Yes, yes! I'd love that!

41
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,889
Okay. Mmm.

42
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:24,450
[snort] Obvious design flaw.

43
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,279
So if I replace these…

44
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,210
…yeah, that should…

45
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:36,949
Right, so believe it or not,
she's operating at — let's be generous — half her potential.

46
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,631
What's with the "she's"?

47
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,849
Oh, Pop says all weapons are girls.

48
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,509
I don't think he realises it's a compliment.

49
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,680
Well, listen, if we had a Thunderjaw's mandibles
to work with her gears would be well and truly greased.

50
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,199
Last commission I had was a month ago.

51
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,549
A weapon that spat fire.

52
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,779
That didn't go well.

53
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,267
I took this thing off an Oseram bandit.

54
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:03,660
You got my Forgefire back?

55
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,609
Well, if you took down Ohlgrund and his goons for this thing,
I guess she's yours now.

56
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,509
Why don't you finish it for me first?

57
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,259
Make it, make her, into the weapon she was supposed to be.

58
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm going to need a Bellowback snout.

59
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,880
Any Bellowback's will do.

60
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,219
Can you handle it alone?

61
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,038
I think I can manage that.

62
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:25,709
So we need parts from a Stormbird and a Thunderjaw?

63
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:26,899
And you know where to find them?

64
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,709
That's right. It's gonna take some travelling, though.

65
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,228
A Stormbird roosts near the Free Heap. I'll pack and meet you out there.

66
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,169
This'll be fun!

67
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,038
Okay.

68
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,450
Hunt it with me, I'll turn that weapon into your new best friend.

69
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,210
Mmm, second best.

70
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,676
BANUK: So machines in the south suffer their own sort of corruption.

71
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:49,857
BANUK: I wonder what sort of challenge they present.

72
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm glad to see you Gildun!

73
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,880
Means I don't have to go pry you out of a flooded dam.

74
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
Ha, yes!

75
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:01,970
I'm glad as well.

76
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,549
Heard the fires were heating up for you.

77
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,439
Back up into the mountain, huh?

78
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,569
That's the plan.

79
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,380
I'm … I'm not sure what I can do to…

80
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,190
If I could do anything to…

81
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:21,549
Heh, you don't want old Gildun tagging along,
getting you trapped some damn place.

82
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,390
But you saved my life, you showed me kindness, so…

83
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,318
So you're here.

84
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,439
So I'm here.

85
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,538
Thanks Gildun.

86
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:30,940
Be safe Aloy.

87
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,395
And when it's done, you come tell me a story for once.

88
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:49,712
SIGNUTAI: Longnotch is well stocked, as you asked.

89
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,722
RUATUK: And our scouts are watching for more Frostclaws.

90
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:55,980
SIGNUTAI: Our numbers rise, three more hunters have passed their trials.

91
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,740
SIGNUTAI: But our purpose was to take back the mountain, now what?

92
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,792
ARATAK: Stay prepared, sharpen your spears.

93
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,639
ARATAK: Should we not return defending The Cut falls to you.

94
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,855
ARATAK: If our chieftain agrees with this course.

95
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:15,834
ALOY: Sounds like good advice, but let's hope it doesn't come to that.

96
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,039
SIGNUTAI: Chieftain.

97
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,838
ARATAK: The weight of command is no small burden.

98
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,259
ALOY: I can see that.

99
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,669
I take it you haven't spoken to Ourea yet?

100
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,849
Why should I?

101
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,624
This is what she wanted, to return to Thunder's Drum.

102
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,549
It is her only care.

103
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,160
ARATAK: So I should have known she would find a way to push aside my spear.

104
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,400
After the Carja took my sister, not all of her came back.

105
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,200
What happened to Ourea when she was a captive of the Carja?

106
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,349
ARATAK: As a Shaman, she's adept with machines, tracking them, stunning them.

107
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,550
ARATAK: The Carja used her to capture them for the Sun Ring
where they were unleashed upon the innocent.

108
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,799
ARATAK: They made her a part of their blood sport.

109
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,239
ARATAK: The shame she suffered beneath their pitiless sun…

110
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,379
ALOY: She survived.

111
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,049
ARATAK: She endured.

112
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:21,259
ARATAK: Endured by reminding herself of the spirit, her purpose.

113
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,140
ARATAK: And now that's all she has.

114
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,379
Tell me what happened to the first expedition.

115
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,259
Ourea led the way to the summit, but it was blocked by a great door.

116
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,750
Some kind of Cauldron, new metal.

117
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,259
ARATAK: We tried to break through, but it was unflinching.

118
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,637
ARATAK: We were exhausted, no way forward and machines behind.

119
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,080
ARATAK: I made the call to push back. It cost us greatly.

120
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,660
ARATAK: But to remain would have cost us everything.

121
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,538
ARATAK: I'd hoped to never subject Ourea to that again.

122
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,600
ALOY: What do you think is beyond that door?

123
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,259
ARATAK: I do not know.

124
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:10,867
ARATAK: That expanse of metal, that dead hum, nothing sacred belongs there.

125
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:16,838
ARATAK: Machines and death, that's what the mountain holds.
Death for us or for the Daemon.

126
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,132
ALOY: And if we do find the spirit?

127
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,589
ARATAK: Then perhaps we should put it out of its misery.

128
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,549
ALOY: For what it's worth, I'm glad you're coming with me.

129
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,549
ARATAK: Someone has to keep Ourea safe.

130
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,508
BANUK: A great werak is put together like a machine. Each part…

131
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,259
NALTUK: I wish you luck on the mountain.

132
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:42,932
Aloy, this is it.

133
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:49,980
My chance to reunite with the spirit,
and perhaps to reunite her with the blue light.

134
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,470
It's not a chance I would have had alone.

135
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,967
I needed an outsider, someone ignorant of our ways, but…

136
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:01,600
…no, not ignorant, I…

137
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,669
Are you trying to thank me Ourea?

138
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,670
Yes, of course.

139
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,160
That's what you do.

140
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,380
Untangle knots, create possibilities.

141
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,306
Thank you for making this pilgrimage possible.

142
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,534
What are we gonna find up there Ourea?

143
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:23,880
Ruins, machines, and a door like that of a Cauldron.

144
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,834
I have faith that you can find a way through it, Aloy.

145
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,160
For beyond it lies the spirit.

146
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,720
I know I could find her there.

147
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,950
Though I do not doubt the Daemon has tried to hide the way.

148
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,759
I only wish it had not been necessary to humiliate Aratak.

149
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,719
You were wise to let him come.

150
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:53,322
He's earned the right, stubborn as stone, but he's had to be.

151
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,450
The war demanded it.

152
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,380
And so have I.

153
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,700
What did the war do to Aratak?

154
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,309
It cut away everything until only his true self remained, unyielding ice.

155
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,140
No Banuk has more sheer will.

156
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,440
He fought the Carja for a thousand freezing nights,
yet always rallied his hunters at sunrise.

157
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,499
It is said he endured twenty-three wounds in those years.

158
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,890
His hunters counted them, he never complains of one.

159
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,173
Instead, he complains that life with me is harder.

160
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,670
He's right. What have I ever given him but struggle?

161
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,234
Aratak told me you were a captive with the Carja for a long time, it sounded bad.

162
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,759
For Aratak it all comes back to that.

163
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,528
He thinks the Carja changed me.

164
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,759
They did not.

165
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:51,420
They merely sharpened my focus.

166
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:57,427
When all else is lost, you think about what's truly important.

167
00:30:57,427 --> 00:31:02,171
The spirit, the blue light, the beyond.

168
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,778
Now that I'm chieftain of the werak,
I don't suppose I can order you to tell me about Sylens?

169
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:13,900
Aratak would never have presumed to grasp for a secret of the Conclave.

170
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:20,467
But you are not Aratak,
and if you have dealt with Sylens, your need is well apparent.

171
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:25,953
Sylens came to Ban-Ur from the distant north,
a young Shaman of the Owl's Watch.

172
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,934
A remote werak that rarely comes south to parlay.

173
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,608
Sylens was a Shaman?

174
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:36,130
He was, or at least when we sent runners
to ask the Owl's Watch, they said he was.

175
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:43,450
His knowledge of the machines was beyond compare,
and he was hungry to trade what he knew to the rest of us.

176
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,219
Didn't take him long to gain the trust of the Conclave,
and eventually an invitation to attend.

177
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,449
What about you? Did you trust him? 

178
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,726
No, but he impressed me.

179
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,729
He carried himself with poise and authority.

180
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,048
I wanted to learn from him.

181
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,980
But that was not to be.

182
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,179
He was granted knowledge of our most sacred meeting place.

183
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,573
The frozen caves of the Malmstrom, a month's march from Ban-Ur.

184
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,099
He met with us there, as is custom, at high winter.

185
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,190
But when we next returned, the caves had been looted.

186
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,893
Relics of the Old World stolen.

187
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:25,939
Holes cut in ice and metal.

188
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,809
Yeah, that would be Sylens alright.

189
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:29,950
He vanished with the spoils.

190
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,834
We sent our best trackers after him, none returned.

191
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:41,825
And when we checked back with the Owl's Watch,
those who had vouched for him were gone.

192
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,259
As though he never existed.

193
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,730
Some in the Conclave began to doubt he was even Banuk to begin with.

194
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,778
And what do you think?

195
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:52,528
He committed an unforgivable sacrilege.

196
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,099
He's unscrupulous and dangerous.

197
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,214
But also brilliant, skilled, and knowledgeable, without equal.

198
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,109
Except perhaps for you.

199
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,289
Anyone else I would warn off, but you may be able to treat with him safely.

200
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,867
It hasn't been easy for you, Ourea, getting back to this point.

201
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,069
It was all to hear her voice again.

202
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:24,980
This time, we both will.

203
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,049
I'd like that.

204
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,450
Finally we ascend.

205
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,900
How? I don't see a way up.

206
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,130
Not up, through.

207
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,549
Now brother!

208
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:27,355
[Naltuk chanting]

209
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:54,170
COMPUTER: This is not a drill.
Please remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit.
OUREA: Come, the spirit awaits.

210
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,800
ARATAK: That's not all that waits.

211
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:05,869
COMPUTER: Smoke has been detected within the facility.
This is not a drill. Please remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit.

212
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,199
So you see, I too can call upon the power of the Old Ones.

213
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,150
ALOY: What was this place?

214
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,039
OUREA: The spirit once told me that this all used to be part of its domain.

215
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,119
OUREA: A fortress that defended humankind from a terrible danger.

216
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,150
ALOY: Fortress? It looks more like a machine.

217
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,329
OUREA: Is that not fitting? The blue light often dwells in machines.

218
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:50,150
ARATAK: Let's just hope that some remains here.

219
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,804
ARATAK: I'm restless, the echoes mock me.

220
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,360
RECORDING: November 21st, 2064.

221
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,798
RECORDING: It's been three years since I was last here,
and twelve since I was running the place.

222
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,546
RECORDING: Just a skeleton crew left, confused about why I'm here.

223
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:43,535
RECORDING: So am I.

224
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,328
RECORDING: Anita wants me to find a way to suspend operations for a while.

225
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:50,929
RECORDING: Maybe a long while, and I don't know why.

226
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:54,449
RECORDING: But from the sound of her voice it was something terrifying.

227
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,019
RECORDING: I wish I could look into her eyes,
ask her what the hell she's so freaked out about?

228
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:04,030
RECORDING: But what else is new.
When don't I wish I could look into her eyes again?

229
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,852
OUREA: Aloy, were you listening for something?

230
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:14,500
ALOY: There are memories here. Messages left by the Old Ones.

231
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,245
OUREA: And you can hear them? I envy you.

232
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,039
OUREA: What did they say?

233
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,380
ALOY: I'm not sure yet, Ourea.

234
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,099
ARATAK: Here, up and over.

235
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,232
Machines. At least we have the drop on them.

236
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,059
Ready or not!

237
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,460
Not this time, little one.

238
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,780
OUREA: I made it!

239
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:35,780
OUREA: We must climb higher, then our path will become clear.

240
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:49,526
ALOY: That should do it, Varga can finish her Forgefire now.

241
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,643
OUREA: We can make our way upwards when you're done, Aloy.

242
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:53,143
ARATAK: If the Chieftain's pace is measured, ours is measured.

243
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,289
OUREA: Yes, this way.

244
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,780
ALOY: Forget about travelling light.

245
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,561
OUREA: There's an overlook above, it's not far.

246
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,210
OUREA: Not much farther now.

247
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,329
ARATAK: Last we were here, we fought our way through there.

248
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,829
ARATAK: But machines overcame us.

249
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,753
ARATAK: We retreated, dropping supplies, and taking losses.

250
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,223
ARATAK: Now we must prevail, with only two warriors and a Shaman to protect.

251
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:08,823
OUREA: Aloy is no ordinary warrior, and I can hold my own.

252
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:13,761
OUREA: Even so, we could go that way instead.

253
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,800
OUREA: There are machines up there, but also cover.

254
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,791
OUREA: We could stay hidden, at least for a while.

255
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,162
ALOY: Alright, I get the options.

256
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,894
ALOY: Now follow my lead.

257
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:35,368
ALOY: Pipes, towers, steam, frost.

258
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:37,800
ALOY: What was all this for?

259
00:45:56,909 --> 00:46:01,182
OUREA: I went this way years ago, 
looking for cover in case machines came prowling.

260
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,443
OUREA: I have no doubt that it is guarded now, but we may be able to stay hidden.

261
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:46,367
ARATAK: Press on.

262
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:07,537
ARATAK: Not all threats can be seen at first. Beware of Stalkers.

263
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,915
OUREA: Stay down as we move through.

264
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,206
ALOY: It's cold, as if there's Chillwater
running through those massive pipes. But why?

265
00:48:36,296 --> 00:48:39,144
ARATAK: We go where you go, Aloy.

266
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:10,927
ARATAK: Let's move, quiet as we can.

267
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,808
ALOY: Calm, calm.

268
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,812
OUREA: Let's not linger any longer than we have to.

269
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:18,880
ALOY: Should have brought a cart.

270
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:33,282
ARATAK: Thought I'd endured every cold there is, but this frost…

271
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,659
OUREA: Aloy, there's an entrance to the tower ahead.

272
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:05,159
ALOY: Won't waste this.

273
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:32,280
ARATAK: On to the tower, before we freeze to our spears.

274
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,157
ARATAK: Be wary of mines, if Stalkers are near.
ALOY: It's freezing, the ground, the air, me.

275
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:02,980
OUREA: Always cold as deepest winter here.

276
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:18,634
OUREA: There's a door up ahead, and refuge. We're almost through.

277
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,096
ARATAK: No need for sneaking.

278
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,767
RECORDING: Technically, I can't suspend the cooling system.

279
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:46,208
RECORDING: But I can reduce the power draw,
so that it'll be completely masked by the caldera.

280
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,250
RECORDING: But masked from what?

281
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,948
RECORDING: Firebreak has always been confidential for security reasons.

282
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:57,940
RECORDING: But this would be excessive, even for the dear departed Mr Blevins.

283
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,840
RECORDING: What could possibly have gotten Anita so worked up?

284
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,639
ALOY: Is this a projector?

285
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,256
ALOY: Maybe to show holograms without a Focus.

286
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:50,328
ALOY: Let's see if I can restore power.

287
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:57,179
ALOY: Aratak, Ourea, you might see shapes drawn from light. Don't be alarmed.

288
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:00,030
ARATAK: It'll take more than light to alarm me.

289
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:13,360
ANITA SANDOVAL: Thank you for being here, everyone.

290
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:19,269
ANITA SANDOVAL: I suppose it's not every day you get
to have cocktails inside an active volcano, right?

291
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:25,039
ANITA SANDOVAL: Unless you're George,
and I can hardly blame him for drinking on the job.

292
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:35,062
ANITA SANDOVAL: None of this would be here
without our beloved director Kenny Chau.

293
00:59:35,062 --> 00:59:36,349
RECORDING: [clapping]

294
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,920
ANITA SANDOVAL: So here's to you, Kenny.

295
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,980
ANITA SANDOVAL: You put a cork in the Yellowstone caldera.

296
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,739
ANITA SANDOVAL: I'd say you deserve a margarita!

297
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,626
RECORDING: [laughter]

298
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,940
KENNY CHAU: Hold your glasses everyone, I'd like to add something.

299
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,030
KENNY CHAU: This effort wouldn't have been possible
without our lead programmer.

300
00:59:58,019 --> 00:59:59,694
KENNY CHAU: Thank you, Anita.

301
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:06,548
KENNY CHAU: For bringing us a real mastermind, CYAN.

302
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,380
CYAN: I'll second that Director Chau.

303
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,708
ANITA SANDOVAL: Alright, CYAN, what's our latest number?

304
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,311
CYAN: The current count is 1,654.

305
01:00:17,311 --> 01:00:22,010
ANITA SANDOVAL: Ha ha! Wow! Then drink up, everyone!

306
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,429
ANITA SANDOVAL: Here's to 1,654 more years without an eruption!

307
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:37,729
OUREA: It was the spirit with the Old Ones.

308
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,218
OUREA: I could only grasp some of what they said.

309
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:42,550
ALOY: You were right, Ourea.

310
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,198
ALOY: This place was built to stop something terrible, and it worked.

311
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:52,672
ALOY: As for the spirit, I'm starting to get an idea of what it could be.

312
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:56,119
OUREA: The door is open now, we can get through.

313
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:13,267
ARATAK: I have a score to settle with that mountain.

314
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:26,888
OUREA: There, below. Door to the mountain. New metal.

315
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:30,405
ARATAK: Dead metal, we could not pass it before.

316
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:35,745
OUREA: We will this time, we have to.

317
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,144
ALOY: We'll have to carve through a lot of machines to get to that door.

318
01:01:44,144 --> 01:01:47,800
ARATAK: More than the werak could prevail against before.

319
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:49,894
OUREA: Aloy will see us through.

320
01:01:49,894 --> 01:01:53,199
ARATAK: Onward then, our challenge awaits.

321
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,898
RECORDING: The geothermal plant can be suspended.

322
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,059
RECORDING: The cooling system masked.

323
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,420
RECORDING: Massive challenges solved.

324
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,349
RECORDING: So why am I so nervous about the next part?

325
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:14,294
RECORDING: All I need to do is
install Anita's mysterious software, and have a conversation.

326
01:02:14,294 --> 01:02:17,585
RECORDING: It's not even a human being, right?

327
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:09,199
ALOY: This'll help.

328
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,209
ALOY: Never know when I might need these.

329
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:54,287
