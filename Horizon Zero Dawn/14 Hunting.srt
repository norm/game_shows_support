1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,638
I'm ready to hunt. So tell me, what do I have to do?

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,160
You want them to regret looking down on you?
Then speak to them in their language.

3
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,289
Kill three Sawtooths, two Ravagers and a Stalker.

4
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,239
Deliver their trophies directly to Ahsis, that should shut them all up.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,739
So if I do that, you'll sponsor me.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,049
I'll consider it.

7
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,450
[Carja noble]
…waste of time.

8
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,750
[Carja merchant]
Check out these wares!

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,069
[Carja merchant]
Only the finest goods here, see for yourself!

10
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,870
That must be the Spire.

11
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,969
It's huge.

12
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,659
[Carja guard]
Always stay bright, always stay alert. That's what I say.

13
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,449
[Carja merchants]
- Don't pass up these goods! 
- You'll like what I have for sale, I promise.

14
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,949
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods.

15
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,338
[Carja merchant]
You'll like what I have for sale, I promise!

16
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,930
[Carja merchants]
- Won't find better wares.
- Come take a look, I'll give you a good price!

17
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,570
[Carja merchant]
You like what I have for sale, I promise.

18
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,739
[Carja merchants]
- You'll like what I have for sale…
- You'll regret not stopping when you're in the thick of it.

19
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,159
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

20
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,448
[Carja merchants]
- Take a look at these wares!
- Won't cost you a shard, just to look!

21
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,449
[rude Carja]
Mind your business outlander.

22
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,849
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods.

23
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,207
[Carja merchant]
Only the finest goods here, see for yourself.

24
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:51,961
[Carja merchant]
Fine goods for a fair price.

25
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

26
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,160
Just stay our of their way for now.

27
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,459
Another day passing.

28
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:38,950
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

29
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,259
Passed the test.

30
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:01,409
Ha!

31
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,059
Low and quiet does it.

32
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,769
Calm, calm.

33
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,160
Keep quiet now.

34
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,670
I can get out of this.

35
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,420
Back to your business.

36
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,960
Here they come.

37
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,970
Here we go again.

38
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,538
Keep that for later.

39
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,549
I'll shake it out later.

40
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,869
Come on!

41
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:51,859
Can't be too prepared.

42
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:30,440
[Carja guard]
It's not what I imagined when I was a boy, but it's decent work keeping the city safe.

43
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,739
That was worth it.

44
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,260
Get it while I can.

45
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:51,861
Dust won't stop blowing.

46
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:21,075
Gotta put up a fight.

47
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:40,780
Got you!

48
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,869
Nutritious.

49
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,659
Let's get on with it.

50
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:34,515
[distant cry]

51
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,968
[distant cry]

52
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:43,210
[distant cry]

53
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,139
[whistle]

54
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,380
[Carja spearman]
Here! A Broadhead!

55
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:06,334
[flashback]
Where is Nakoa now?

56
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,010
[flashback]
I don't know exactly.

57
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:11,800
[flashback]
She left raving that she would find a way to bring me down.

58
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,009
[flashback]
But I did hear a report from the garrison at Lonesome Rock,

59
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:19,053
[flashback]
that a young woman had been abducted by bandits. Might have been her.

60
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:25,190
This must be Lonesome Rock.

61
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:28,079
If it's a trap, I might need to go in quiet.

62
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:41,780
[Carja guard]
I'm so bored, I'm bored with being bored.

63
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,738
[Carja guard]
I'm bored with you talking about being bored.

64
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:45,168
[Aloy]
Seems like an ordinary outpost.

65
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,388
[Carja guard]
I'm bored with you complaining about me being bored.

66
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,138
[Aloy]
I'd better look around.

67
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:50,238
[Carja guard]
I wasn't complaining about you being bored.

68
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,710
[Carja guard]
I was complaining about your complaining.

69
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:55,568
[Carja guard]
Well, now I'm complaining about your complaining.

70
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:01,579
[Carja head guard]
If you two don't shut up, I'm going to complain to Zaid, and then things will get ugly.

71
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,519
[Aloy]
There are chains in the cart.

72
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,348
[Carja head guard]
Hold Outlander!

73
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,918
What are you doing here?

74
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,958
Hunting.

75
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,718
I've been tracking a Sawtooth for the better part of a day.

76
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,978
Well, you must have lost the scent because we haven't seen any round here.

77
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,610
Now, be on your way and quickly.

78
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,289
[Carja head guard]
She's snooping around!

79
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,579
[Carja head guard]
Wrap up and tie her down boys.

80
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:42,000
[Carja guard]
I'm down.

81
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,269
Alright, let's see what Zaid's hiding out here.

82
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,489
Well, they don't want to talk, so let's see if they're hiding something.

83
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,880
Not just chains, manacles.

84
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,519
They were moving prisoners somewhere.

85
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,670
The tracks lead to that compound.

86
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:56,679
Maybe Nakoa is inside.

87
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,269
[Carja outlander]
That Nora girl we got in the hole is nice and lean.

88
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:24,670
[Carja outlander]
Don't get ideas.

89
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:28,280
[Carja outlander]
Zaid says hands off or it'll hurt her price at auction.

90
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:30,579
Sounds like Nakoa is here.

91
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:33,480
And I'm gonna have to cut through these guards to get to her.

92
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,570
You can see them, they can't see you.

93
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,670
[Carja outlander]
I see him!

94
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,828
[in the distance]
Is someone there?

95
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,409
[Prisoner]
Please, help us get out of here.

96
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,738
Prisoners chained up to be sold as slaves.

97
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,840
[Prisoner]
Talk to Nakoa. She'll know what to do.

98
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,928
Nakoa? Yan sent me.

99
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:12,918
Look, we can talk more once we get everyone out of this pit.

100
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,530
Yan sent you?

101
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:16,659
I don't believe it.

102
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,718
I guess one of his prayers finally worked.

103
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:21,818
You'll need a key to get us out.

104
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,638
One of Zaid's men should have it.

105
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,039
I've got the key.

106
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,868
I'll help the others.

107
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,150
Let's go!

108
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:53,900
I knew you were going to be trouble, girl,
but you will make it worth our while in the end.

109
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:58,369
The end is now Zaid! For you and your men.

110
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,019
[Aloy]
You gave him a quicker death than he deserved.

111
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,150
My father was a hunter.

112
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:01,440
He taught me every animal deserves a clean kill.

113
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,608
How did Zaid come to run a ring of slavers?

114
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,708
All the scum you just killed.

115
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,699
They butchered for Zaid during the Red Raids.

116
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,178
The new Sun-King kicked them out of the army.

117
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:14,792
But Zaid managed to lie his way out of trouble.

118
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:19,130
Then saw a new way to make a shard putting his grunts to work here.

119
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,130
How did Zaid capture you?

120
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,608
I tried to get him at Daytower, but he caught me.

121
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,808
Then let me go so he could have his men grab me later.

122
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,121
And after?

123
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:35,250
Said he was gonna sell me into slavery like the other
poor bastards that came through here week to week.

124
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:39,449
But he took his time, kicked me around whenever he stopped by.

125
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,708
Guess me trying to kill him hurt his pride.

126
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,408
You've been through a lot.

127
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,630
I'm fine.

128
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,034
Are you sure?

129
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,650
Zaid's dead.

130
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,239
I was ready to go through anything to make that happen.

131
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,639
And I did.

132
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,530
What are you gonna do now?

133
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,239
The others were in that cellar for months.

134
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,829
The more run down they got, the harder it was for Zaid to sell them.

135
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,628
They need food, rest, and hope.

136
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,498
I'll take them to Meridian and tend to them.

137
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,739
You're not even going to try to go back?

138
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,329
What about Yan?

139
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,398
The Matriarchs won't let me back.

140
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,458
Even if they would, I wouldn't go.

141
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,519
They can burn for all I care.

142
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,110
As for Yan, I know a way to get word to him.

143
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,098
I'll miss that runt, but at least he'll know I'm safe.

144
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:28,320
Time for me to go.

145
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:30,820
Look, I don't even know your story.

146
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,043
Must be a good one if they gave you the mark of a Seeker.

147
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:37,739
If you ever feel like telling it, look me up in Meridian.

148
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,170
I'll be there until the others get back up on their feet.

149
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,610
Until then,

150
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,519
…thank you…

151
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:48,239
…for helping me cut this rot from the world.

152
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,420
I don't know.

153
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,809
Maybe now I can put Zaid behind me and remember my father as I should.

154
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,420
Thanks again, for all your help.
