1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,250
ALOY: I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.

2
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,079
ALOY: Fine!

3
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,609
What do I have to do?

4
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,800
Get the werak's attention to show the worth of your claim.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,539
Win at the hunting grounds.

6
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,279
Kill bandits that prey on The Cut.

7
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:41,340
They don't dare taunt the great weraks of Ban-Ur to the north.

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,789
But The Cut is easier prey.

9
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,549
A rogue Oseram has equipped a gang in the Plumelands with strange new gear.

10
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,850
Just the kind of thing you seem to make sense of.

11
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,650
Must be the cave that Shaman told me about.

12
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,431
Long way down, and not natural either.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,750
Might not be alone down here.

14
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,750
Here's one of the metal birds.

15
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,588
Something's been hacked out of it.

16
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,280
Maybe I can find another of these flying machines.

17
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,389
Full already.

18
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,449
Just have to go up.

19
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,379
If I could move that flying machine over a little…

20
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,669
Could use my Focus, see what it turns up.

21
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,610
Maybe there's some way to get that flying machine over here.

22
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,839
Huh, not so grounded after all.

23
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,750
Now I can get across.

24
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,050
There's the door lock.

25
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,750
I'll need to configure it.

26
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:36,069
RECORDING: If those punk technicians think I'm gonna sleep on them
waltzing in here and screwing around with the drone routines,

27
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,899
RECORDING: They have seriously underestimated my sense of mission.

28
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,039
RECORDING: Let's just reset that hololock, echo, zero, echo.

29
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,169
RECORDING: I didn't ask for a bunch of flying cameras.

30
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,539
RECORDING: I need security, not surveillance.

31
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,919
RECORDING: And security means firepower.

32
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:38,659
RECORDING: As God is my witness, I will not be caught squirting blanks
if and when a major act of terrorism desecrates these facilities.

33
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,949
No-one's touched this machine since it got sealed in here.

34
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,350
Shouldn't be hard to remove.

35
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,050
I'll show it to that Shaman when I'm back in Song's Edge.

36
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,339
First strike!

37
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,179
So this thing will improve my spear, huh?

38
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,980
So much for being careful.

39
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,509
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

40
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,240
RECORDING: Ursus americanus.

41
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,751
RECORDING: The magnificent American black bear.

42
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,259
RECORDING: Brought to you by Montana Recreations!

43
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,185
ENJUK: Never even felt the cold, did you?

44
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:48,167
ENJUK: If he hadn't preserved you, would anyone even know you'd disappeared?

45
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,548
I hate to interrupt…

46
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,937
Oh! I…! Yes, hello, I…

47
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:03,029
An outlander at the Shrine of Forgotten Beasts.

48
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,480
Welcome. I'm Enjuk.

49
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,259
Uh, Aloy.

50
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:09,028
The shine of what?

51
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:17,324
When the Old World still breathed a great man built
a tiny totem to this beast and stored the visage inside.

52
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,720
When the totem is placed on the pedestal…

53
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:27,610
…the animal is painted onto the empty air and the beast lives again.

54
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,460
Well, almost.

55
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,049
You said a great man made these figurines?

56
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,900
Indeed. He was, I believe, a student of the natural world.

57
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,490
Like me, but surpassing my abilities a thousand times over.

58
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,410
The great Montana Recreations.

59
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,270
Perhaps the finest natural scholar the Old World ever produced.

60
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,877
His voice claims responsibility for the totems, the vessels.

61
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:57,848
For the knowledge he accumulated.

62
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:04,778
I share his desire to understand the beasts,
to catalogue their behaviours and preserve their images.

63
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,838
I like to flatter myself that I'm an apprentice of sorts.

64
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,788
We rely as much on beasts as we do on machines, for food, for warmth.

65
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,169
But do we study them with the same fervour? I do!

66
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,259
For example, I have this theory about foxes.

67
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,190
Why do foxes have red fur?

68
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,470
Think about what they eat.

69
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,854
Meat?

70
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,349
Raw meat, bloody meat, see?

71
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:38,180
Natural causation, logical connections. It only makes sense.

72
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,516
You've thought a lot more about foxes than I have.

73
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:45,613
Someday, perhaps, if I am persistent, I can earn his name.

74
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,349
Enjuk Recreations.

75
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,480
So these totems, the images they show are of animals that no longer exist.

76
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,440
They're gone, like the Old Ones.

77
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,315
So it seems.

78
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:07,759
I found this one in the wilds, remembered the indentations 
in the pedestals here, and saw how they matched the base of the totem.

79
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:16,326
The great Montana Recreations must have made more,
but time has scattered them.

80
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,783
RECORDING: Ursus americanus.

81
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:39,772
RECORDING: The magnificent American black bear.

82
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,889
RECORDING: Brought to you by Montana Recreations!

83
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,318
ALOY: How would you like to find yourself cornered by that thing?

84
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,618
ENJUK: I suspect I'd like it very much indeed!

85
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,019
ENJUK: What a beautiful beast you were.

86
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,400
What do you think of these, Enjuk?

87
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:10,160
ENJUK: The Cut may have forgotten you, little ones, but I will not.

88
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,400
ENJUK: And now that you've returned to your pedestals, I can show others!

89
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,168
RECORDING: Odocoileus virginianus.

90
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:26,881
RECORDING: The majestic mule deer.

91
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,980
RECORDING: Brought to you by Montana Recreations!

92
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,047
ENJUK: Not built like a predator, but…

93
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:36,839
ENJUK: Perhaps it needed those horns
to take down its prey in the absence of sharp fangs?

94
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:45,828
RECORDING: Ursus arctos.

95
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:48,634
RECORDING: The menacing grizzly bear.

96
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,623
RECORDING: Brought to you by Montana Recreations!

97
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,187
ALOY: Those claws look like they could rip someone in half.

98
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:57,019
ENJUK: Perhaps in its youth, but you heard Montana Recreations.

99
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,349
ENJUK: He said it's grizzled, old. It's hunting days are behind it.

100
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:10,219
RECORDING: Puma Concolor.

101
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,570
RECORDING: The fearsome cougar.

102
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,503
RECORDING: Brought to you by Montana Recreations!

103
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:19,670
ENJUK: Its coat is sand coloured. Could it have been a burrowing animal?

104
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,210
ENJUK: Perhaps those teeth were only used for digging.

105
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,049
I can't spare the weight.

106
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,700
I forget what warmth feels like out here.

107
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,961
I'm ready, gotta be!

108
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,372
Strange tones in this stuff.

109
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,050
Found me, even though I'm hidden.

110
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,061
You can see them, but they can't see you.

111
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:19,112
BANDIT: Try to run!

112
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:45,145
BANDIT: Why? Why? Take this!

113
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,813
Their helmets are as thick as machine plating.

114
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,449
That shot knocked it off.

115
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,539
Bandits aren't subtle.

116
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,739
Clearing them out would send a different kind of message.

117
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,849
They won't be using this again.

118
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:40,909
No room.

119
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,329
I'd have to leave something else behind.

120
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,730
Don't mind me.

121
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,329
Save these for the trail.

122
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,429
Ah, she went that-a-way!

123
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:27,400
Finally.

124
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,239
Smells peaceful.

125
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,489
I hate peace.

126
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:09,289
A lot of people die peacefully.

127
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,739
Not me.

128
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,400
I got a feeling.

129
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,289
Search the camp!

130
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:21,128
BANDIT LEADER: Call that a search?

131
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,873
BANDIT LEADER: Glad I don't pay you lardskills a retainer.

132
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:48,408
BANDIT LEADER: Could any of you find a charcoal pile in a flat field?

133
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,512
BANDIT LEADER: I don't think so!

134
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,014
BANDIT: Too close!

135
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,389
BANDIT: She's still here?

136
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:43,780
BANDIT: Somebody needs a killing!

137
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:00,699
BANDIT: Wanna play?  Here's your invitation.

138
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,718
ALOY: He's down, and won't be torching anything else.

139
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,619
BANDIT: This'll ruin you.

140
00:49:41,056 --> 00:49:44,179
The Oseram's fire weapon, could come in handy.

141
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,739
BANDIT: Got another shot for you.

142
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:13,679
BANUK: …the frozen Tallneck in the Frostfigures.

143
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,248
BANUK: We sing the songs of our ancestors.
