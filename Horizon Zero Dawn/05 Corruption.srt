1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,159
Aloy.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,257
Survive.

3
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:09,545
She is dying!

4
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:24,497
To take her there is blasphemy!

5
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:27,129
She should be near her mother!

6
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:41,423
Aloy, I'm so sorry.

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,029
Turn your face to the sun, child.

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,003
Rost.

9
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,805
No. No, no, no, no.

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,663
I have to get out of here.

11
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,178
i need my focus, now.

12
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,445
They … they must have found me before I 
bled out.

13
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:53,023
But why is no one here? Where am I?

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,973
My clothes, good.
But where's my focus?

15
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,840
It's here, okay.

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,178
Am I inside the sacred mountain?

17
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:45,840
But only Matriarchs are allowed inside.

18
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,321
I … I don't see my bow here.

19
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:12,610
Or that damaged focus. The one I took off that killer.

20
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,240
Where are they?

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,691
I'm picking up some kind of signal.

22
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,711
It must be the damaged focus.
The one I took from that killer.

23
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,211
It's close.

24
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,496
Looks like the ruins I fell into when I was young.

25
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,007
The Nora didn't build this place, the Old Ones did.

26
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,735
But why?

27
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,423
There! With the rest of my things.

28
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,840
Now, what can you show me?

29
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,540
All commanders: halt excavations and proceed
at once to the mission point.

30
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,264
Avoid all contact with Nora savages.

31
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:48,259
But if you are seen kill every witness.

32
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,840
Target imaging attached. Do not fail.

33
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
"Target imaging"?

34
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
"Who says I'm like other Nora?"

35
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,747
They saw me through Olin's focus.

36
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:15,129
How is that possible?

37
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,909
"Better make it quick, I'm heading in."

38
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,480
"Hold for Identiscan."

39
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,403
"You need to stop listening to Ted,
and start listening to me."

40
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,218
Where is this from? And when?

41
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,267
Are you my mother?

42
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:53,618
Why try to kill me just because I look like you?

43
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,795
[in the distance]
Aloy!

44
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,467
Aloy, you are awake!

45
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,238
You brought me here?

46
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,227
Quickly, you must follow.

47
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:05,587
To where?

48
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:07,570
To the place where you were born.

49
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,686
Are you saying I was born here, inside the mountain?

50
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,246
It is easier if I show you.

51
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,385
Why did you bring me here?

52
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:32,400
It seemed you were dying,
and to die near one's mother is sacred.

53
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,701
Lansra fought it of course, but Jezza sided with me.

54
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,582
Is my mother here?

55
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:56,605
Am I going to meet her?

56
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:59,824
It's complicated please just follow me.

57
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,122
Does my mother look like me, but with short hair?

58
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,562
I don't see how that could be.

59
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:22,686
You were not born of a woman, Aloy.

60
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:25,245
The mountain is your mother.

61
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:31,811
What? What are you talking about?

62
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,850
Come.

63
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,992
What is this place?

64
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:55,769
The great chamber where All-Mother slew the Metal Devil,
and gave birth to you.

65
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,424
Aloy, the Proving massacre was just the first of many disasters.

66
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:07,776
The war party we sent after the killers was ambushed and slaughtered.

67
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,478
But what does that have to do with where I was born?

68
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:14,141
My hope is… everything.

69
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,892
This is where we found you.

70
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:24,961
We heard your cries, came to look, and there you were.

71
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,946
Just … just lying there?

72
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:30,291
Yes!

73
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,736
You mean I came from behind the door?

74
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:38,082
Always that is what I have believed.

75
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:40,942
That you came from the womb of the mountain.

76
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:43,760
A gift from All-Mother herself.

77
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,027
But others, like Lansra, feared that a darker power put you here.

78
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:54,648
Not a gift, but a curse.

79
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,175
But this isn't a goddess.

80
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:00,307
Aloy!

81
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:04,506
It's a door … with people behind it.

82
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,071
My mother?

83
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,161
Hold for Identiscan.

84
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,118
The Goddess speaks!

85
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,629
Just like the woman I saw.

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,946
Error. Alpha Registry corrupted.

87
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:36,993
Identity cannot be confirmed. Entry denied.

88
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,560
No, no...

89
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,840
Please!

90
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,840
Aloy, All-Mother spoke to you as if She knew you.

91
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,536
Were you not listening?

92
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,980
It didn't recognize me.

93
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,960
Because of corruption! The Goddess's own words.

94
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,840
Surely if you heal this corruption She will see you clearly.

95
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,801
And how would I do that?

96
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:34,880
You said you've had visions of a woman with short hair.

97
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,825
The killers came for me because I look like her.

98
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,666
But their power is overwhelming!
Is there no other trail to follow?

99
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:50,974
Olin. He was one of the outsiders the night before the Proving.

100
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,926
The killers saw me through his eyes.

101
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,476
He lives in Meridian.

102
00:11:57,476 --> 00:12:00,303
So you will have to leave the Sacred Land.

103
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
I've been an outcast all my life.

104
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,336
Why not an exile too?

105
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:10,320
Shh, there is another way.

106
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,888
Come and we will make it so.

107
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,081
You said the tribe is on the brink of extinction.

108
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,253
What happened?

109
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:28,899
After the massacre at the Proving,
a great war party was sent after the killers.

110
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,960
Less than half survived.

111
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,904
How was the war party defeated?

112
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,576
The killers do not fight alone.

113
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:45,069
Somehow they have a power over the machines,
corrupting them, driving them mad.

114
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,758
So the killers got away?

115
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:51,651
Yes, and now the only plan my sister Matriarchs can agree to…

116
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:55,111
…is to sing the Hymn of Atonement
and beg for All-Mother's mercy.

117
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:58,029
As though She would not want us to help ourselves!

118
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,646
Then what's your plan?

119
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,629
This. This was my plan.

120
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:09,440
To show you where you were born and loose you
to follow the destiny All-Mother intended for you.

121
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,162
The other High Matriarchs are waiting for us.

122
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,350
Let me do the talking.

123
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,120
Sisters, the Goddess spoke to Aloy.
Told her to heal the corruption.

124
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,300
Ha!

125
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,142
But how is she to do that?

126
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:47,595
She will have to journey beyond our Sacred Land.

127
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,209
A Seeker?

128
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,462
If the Goddess spoke it must be so.

129
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:55,793
You would name this thing a seeker?

130
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,327
Sister!

131
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:59,778
For once, Lansra, join with us!

132
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:03,954
Pff! This will be your sin not mine.

133
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:07,354
Send her seeking and may she never be seen again.

134
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,080
Aloy, by the holy grace of the one Goddess,
we hereby anoint you a Seeker of the Nora Tribe.

135
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
No barrier can now stay you from your sacred task.

136
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,622
May All-Mother protect you and sustain you.

137
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:36,720
Stay true.

138
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,840
I will make ready for the hymn.

139
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
Our hopes lie with you.

140
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,458
Teersa, what's a Seeker?

141
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:04,254
You are.
And here is your mark.

142
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:09,054
In times of great need the High Matriarchs may anoint a Seeker.

143
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:12,320
A worthy Brave sent forth to accomplish a great purpose.

144
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,279
No matter where that purpose might take her.

145
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,720
Even beyond the borders of the Sacred Land?

146
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,620
Yes. And with the right to return when you are 
done.

147
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,723
Or as the need arises.

148
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:29,739
So I can go anywhere at all? No restrictions?

149
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:34,400
Even to forbidden places,
like the tainted lands beyond All-Mother's sight.

150
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,752
Or the ruins of the Metal World.

151
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:40,320
Why are the ruins of the Metal World forbidden?

152
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,076
They are blighted places Aloy.

153
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,811
Dark and wicked, like the children of metal who built them.

154
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:55,736
When they rebelled and tried to murder All-Mother,
Her wrath leveled their cities but could not cleanse their sin.

155
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:58,669
Their ancient spite haunts those ruins.

156
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:01,440
Ready to ensnare anyone foolish enough to enter them.

157
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,441
But I've been in a ruin.
It looked a lot like the inside of All-Mother.

158
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,461
This is something beyond my understanding.

159
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:13,648
I will trust you to reveal the truth.

160
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:17,221
Why are the lands beyond Nora territory called tainted?

161
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,988
Is it not obvious?

162
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,649
Our land is sacred.

163
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,662
We live in sight of the one Goddess,
All-Mother, source of all that lives.

164
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:31,520
Beyond Her sight lies a vast fallen land, spiritually tainted.

165
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,890
That is why it is against tribal law to leave.

166
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,189
But the Seeker blessing will protect you.

167
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,320
So many have suffered.
Is there anything I can do to help?

168
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,914
What is most important is for you
to fulfil the purpose All-Mother has intended for you.

169
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:52,022
I don't know what that means any more than you do.

170
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:54,038
Then you must find out.

171
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,080
Have there been other Seekers?

172
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,255
There have, but they are rare,
and most who set out are never heard from again.

173
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,695
Was Rost a Seeker?

174
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,386
No…

175
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,629
Not a Seeker.

176
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,568
What are you not telling me?

177
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,590
This is not the time, Aloy.

178
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,452
What was done with Rost's body?

179
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,625
I'm afraid there was very little left to recover.

180
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:25,516
But what there was,
we buried at the place where he raised you.

181
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,120
With flowers on the grave.

182
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,413
Thank you.

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,254
From here you must go to the gates of the Embrace.

184
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:37,040
Speak to Varl and he will point the way to Meridian.

185
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,907
If any Nora tries to stand in your way Aloy,
make sure they know you are a Seeker.

186
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,621
Oh I will.

187
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,396
Thank you Teersa, for all you've done.

188
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:52,124
May All-Mother bless you and watch over you.

189
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
[in the distance]
Nora faithful, we will soon begin.

190
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,911
[in the distance]
Purify your hearts.

191
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:05,468
[in the distance]
Soon we will beg forgiveness for the sins that brought such misery on the tribe.

192
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:08,457
[in the distance]
When we hear the Matriarchs lift their voices,

193
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:11,837
[in the distance]
we will join ours to theirs.

194
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:16,732
[passerby]
The motherless girl, back on her feet!

195
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:22,539
[passerby]
The Outcast girl! So she survived her wounds.

196
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
[passerby]
She saved many lives. The tribe is lucky to have her.

197
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,339
[in the distance]
Aloy!

198
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,846
Teb?

199
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,438
All-Mother be praised!

200
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,072
I'm so glad to know you're all right.

201
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:18,534
I heard the rumors but I didn't know for sure
until I saw you just now.

202
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,800
And you're even wearing the tunic I stitched for you.

203
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,334
I'm honoured.

204
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,581
What sort of rumours did you hear?

205
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,720
That you were wounded, expected to die.

206
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,360
And then High Matriarch Teersa insisted
that you be allowed to heal inside All-Mother.

207
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,054
Huh, that caused a stir.

208
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,440
Only Matriarchs are allowed to enter the mountain, but…

209
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,504
…you deserve the honour.

210
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:52,547
The survivors had told everyone how you fought to save them.

211
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:55,500
I wasn't the only one to fight.

212
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,688
No, they spoke of Bast and Vala too.

213
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:03,520
And rost, the man who raised me.

214
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,047
He fought to save me and he died for it.

215
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:11,760
The survivors didn't speak of him, but I remember him.

216
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,926
He was there that day when you saved 
me.

217
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:20,094
I remember, he stepped in front of you
when my father started yelling.

218
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:24,583
If, by dying, he saved your life Aloy.

219
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,354
I don't think he regretted it.

220
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:31,646
What are you doing here with a bow and spear, Teb?
You're a Stitcher not a Brave.

221
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:37,280
Most of our Braves are dead or wounded, Aloy.
Someone has to defend Mother's Watch.

222
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,839
So I thought i'd help out.

223
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:45,797
I should be okay, just as long as
I don't try to run any Brave Trails, right?

224
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,887
I need the gate opened.

225
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:51,440
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is out there?

226
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,077
Are the killers still there?

227
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:56,007
No, they're long gone.

228
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,044
The war party went after them.

229
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,634
But the killers slaughtered them.

230
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:06,224
They have some evil power over the machines.

231
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,877
They corrupt them, make them fight at their side.

232
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:14,560
And these corrupted machines, they're loose in the embrace?

233
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,431
Some have broken through.

234
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:20,657
And from what I hear it's even worse outside the Embrace.

235
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:23,832
Believe me this is no time to go traveling.

236
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,776
I need to pass through.

237
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:29,099
You'll have to talk to Resh then, up on the wall.

238
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,970
He's the new War-Chief. I'm not sure he'll help you.

239
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,862
Why wouldn't Resh help me?

240
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,873
Well, he says…

241
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,736
…mean things about you.

242
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:44,232
That I'm a motherless curse? An outcast? That sort of thing?

243
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:45,112
Yeah.

244
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,041
I should be on my way Teb.

245
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,720
May All-Mother go with you.

246
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,164
Ah, the outcast approaches.

247
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:01,082
Ignore her, continue 
the report.

248
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:03,593
There are rumours of a demon loose in the embrace.

249
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:06,800
A thing of dark metal that corrupts every machine it touches.

250
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,387
Where did it come from?

251
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,840
They say it broke through the gates of the Embrace.

252
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,821
Who is they?

253
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:19,463
Varl and his followers.
They tried to stop it but the demon was too fast, too powerful.

254
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:25,546
Varl's a fool to defend that gate.
It is here at Mother's Watch that we will make our stand.

255
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:30,400
So far eight groups have arrived from Mother's Heart
to join the Hymn of Atonement, and more are on the way.

256
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,838
Good. All true Nora will lift their voices in song.

257
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,683
Uh, she's still here.

258
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,840
I don't care.

259
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,444
I need the gate opened.

260
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,814
Since when has any outcast's need been my concern?

261
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,801
I recognise you from the Proving.

262
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,606
You saw Bast shatter my trophy and you did nothing.

263
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:58,041
You would speak ill of the dead? Truly you have no shame.

264
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,701
I nearly put an arrow through your eye.

265
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,640
And you threaten me in front of witnesses?

266
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,840
When the High Matriarchs hear of this
you'll be an outcast all over again.

267
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,728
I've been anointed a Seeker, so open the gate!

268
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:17,280
You, a Seeker? Have Teersa and Jezza gone insane?

269
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,553
Bad enough that they let you run in the Proving.

270
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:26,187
But to nurse you back to health inside the sacred mountain?

271
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:30,238
If you think Teersa and Jeeza are traitors,
why don't you head up the mountain and say that to their faces?

272
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,720
Or do you only talk big when your superiors aren't around?

273
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
No wonder a curse is upon us
and children lie dead under cairns of stone.

274
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,564
How can you be so heartless?

275
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:44,463
I fought beside those children shoulder to shoulder and back to back.

276
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:46,259
I saw them fall!

277
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,150
If even one of them had been true Nora,
they would have put an arrow in your back.

278
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,314
Resh, come on.

279
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:54,374
Silence!

280
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:57,332
Where were you when those 
children were being slaughtered?

281
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,314
Or the war party ambushed?

282
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,934
Guarding your little gate here?

283
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:05,400
I am the Nora War-Chief and this gate is Mother's Watch!

284
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,582
And I am a Seeker anointed by the High Matriarchs!

285
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,040
So open the gate and I will be on my way.

286
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,693
The sooner you're gone from here the better.

287
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:18,204
What was that?

288
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:38,815
The demon!

289
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,963
Sound the alarm!

290
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:44,963
[gong]

291
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,481
By the Goddess! What's it doing to them?

292
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,399
Taking control.

293
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,764
Brace yourselves!

294
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,061
What have you brought on us now, you motherless curse?

295
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:27,840
Kill them Braves! Kill them all!

296
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
[in the distance]
Braves! Ready yourselves!

297
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:35,702
[in the distance]
Today we fight a curse! A demon!

298
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,859
[in the distance]
All-Mother give us strength!

299
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,280
Won't be long.

300
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,575
Gotta get in position.

301
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,659
It's down!

302
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:08,665
How does it possess other machines?

303
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:11,312
What's its secret?

304
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,800
How does a machine like that take control of all those Striders?

305
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,120
One of these things marched with the killers at the Proving.

306
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:33,135
How'd you do it? Show me.

307
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,935
You made them obey you, how?

308
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:42,292
This, you did it with this.

309
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,265
It's connecting to my Focus!

310
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:49,068
Then I could use this?

311
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,296
It's worth a shot.

312
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:56,049
Couple loops of wire, looks like it'll hold.

313
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,207
I just need to test it.

314
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,992
Aloy, how did you do that?

315
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:08,039
You killed that demon, pulled its guts from the carcass.

316
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,790
The way it controls other machines.

317
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,800
I think i figured it out, but I need to test it on a machine.

318
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,369
Uh, plenty of Striders along the path to the gates of the Embrace I guess.

319
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:24,298
Exactly! And the gates are where I'll be headed anyway.

320
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:26,676
I need to speak to Varl.

321
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,734
I always knew you were different Aloy, but…

322
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,130
"But" what?

323
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,817
I think you're a blessing from All-Mother.

324
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:35,561
No matter what Resh says.

325
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,600
Thank you, Teb.

326
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,057
But I have to go now.

327
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:44,391
I know you do and my thoughts go with you.

328
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:52,049
[in the distance]
Braves! I want that gate repaired immediately!

329
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,724
[in the distance]
I don't care if you have to bandage it together, get it done.

330
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,027
[in the distance]
They say she fought beside Bast and Vala.

331
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:19,344
I need to test this device, see what it can do.

332
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,260
Home. To you think he built all this alone.

333
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,160
So many memories.

334
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,213
It's not home anymore, not without Rost.

335
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:32,927
There's nothing for me here anymore.

336
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,300
Rost, I couldn't leave the Sacred Land without visiting you.

337
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:09,506
When you said goodbye…

338
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
…I told you I'd find you,

339
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,309
track you down.

340
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,640
Well, looks like you did it after all.

341
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,409
Went somewhere I can't follow

342
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,856
I should have known you'd be watching,

343
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,867
At the Proving, looking out for me.

344
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:33,296
There for me when no one else was.

345
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,466
Like always.

346
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,328
One last time. Thank you Rost.

347
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,000
I won't waste what you've given me, I promise.

348
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,858
I'll make you proud.

349
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:55,485
I've been…

350
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,083
…trying to puzzle it out but nothing makes sense.

351
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,619
The killers came after me because I look like this…

352
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,988
…a woman. Older, with short hair.

353
00:39:08,988 --> 00:39:13,254
But why, and what's the connection?

354
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:18,494
If she's my mother then she didn't look Nora.

355
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:23,936
But if she lives inside the mountain
how could the killers know about her?

356
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,997
The more I learn the less I understand.

357
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:32,030
I need to track down Olin, an outsider.

358
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,281
He was at the festival the night before the Proving.

359
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,452
Somehow the killers saw me through his Focus.

360
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:47,776
And he knew it. He could have warned me.

361
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,415
When I find him, well, he's gonna tell me everything he knows.

362
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,710
And he's gonna pay.

363
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,831
All right it's, uh, it's time to leave the Embrace.

364
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,853
I'll try to come back when I can.

365
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,890
Ouch!

366
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,361
Striders. I can test the override device on them.

367
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,473
Should go in quiet.

368
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:54,820
Didn't go through all of this
to wind up trampled by a frightened herd.

369
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:56,406
[whistle]

370
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,840
Nice and quiet.

371
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,509
Alright, here it goes!

372
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:16,672
Come on, come on…

373
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,251
It worked!

374
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:21,347
It's not hostile.

375
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:23,334
It seems almost tame.

376
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:25,040
I think I could ride it.

377
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,973
There we go, attaboy!

378
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:31,542
That's more like it.

379
00:44:40,335 --> 00:44:43,319
Yah! Yah, yah!

380
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,728
Ride!

381
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,733
This Strider is fast!

382
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,893
This beats walking!

383
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,920
I should try overriding other kinds of machines.

384
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,128
Probably can't ride them all,
but I might find a use for them.

385
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,691
Sounds of fighting just outside the gates?

386
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,848
The gates look shattered.

387
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:37,189
[in the distance]
Watch yourselves! Bring it closer! Closer!

388
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,445
Varl, I take it?

389
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:55,520
Am I seeing things…

390
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,515
…or were you riding that Strider when you came through the gate?

391
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:03,040
Uh, I was. It's hard to explain.

392
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,357
I imagine so.

393
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:09,055
Strange times we live in, we who've survived.

394
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,225
I recognise you of course.

395
00:46:12,225 --> 00:46:15,317
Aloy, the outcast who won the Proving.

396
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:18,406
I'm glad to see you survived your wounds.

397
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:20,134
How did you know that?

398
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,688
I spoke to survivors. They say you fought bravely.

399
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:25,330
As did Bast.

400
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,206
And my sister.

401
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:28,960
Your sister was Vala?

402
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:33,358
I'm very sorry.

403
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:35,560
Thank you.

404
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:40,000
She died saving others. There is no better death.

405
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,410
High Matriarch Teersa said you might know the way to Meridian.

406
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,360
The capital of the Carja Sundom?

407
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,755
You seek exile?

408
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:52,331
No, a traitor named Olin.

409
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:55,506
The Matriarchs made me a Seeker so I could go after him.

410
00:46:56,453 --> 00:46:58,945
Then you should head north to Mother's Crown.

411
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:02,025
If you make it, talk to Marea, she'll point the way.

412
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:02,906
If I make it?

413
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,068
The trail is dangerous.

414
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:10,435
Ever since the War Party massacre our lands go unpatrolled
and our borders unguarded.

415
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,954
We have no War-Chief to lead us.

416
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:15,628
Isn't that Resh's job?

417
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,470
Ugh.

418
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,749
When word came of the attack on the Proving, 
War-Chief Sona assembled a War Party to give chase.

419
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:26,558
But in their haste to get vengeance,
some Braves broke rank and raced ahead.

420
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:27,840
Straight into a trap.

421
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:36,103
A pack of crazed machines seething with corruption
fell upon the braves and savaged them.

422
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,779
War-Chief Sona led a counter-charge
and destroyed the machines but…

423
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:45,605
By then the killers were gone and our losses were extreme.

424
00:47:45,605 --> 00:47:48,395
She called for volunteers and went after the killers.

425
00:47:48,395 --> 00:47:50,052
You didn't volunteer?

426
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,261
Of course I did but Sona denied me that.

427
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,340
She ordered me to see the wounded back to the Embrace.

428
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,982
And to guard this gate,
to guard the Embrace, with my life.

429
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:06,912
That was days ago and since then there's been no word from her.

430
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:09,799
So there's no way to know if she's alive or dead.

431
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:12,799
If anyone could survive out there it would be her.

432
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,891
Sona's prowess is legend.

433
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,840
An unbending spear to measure ourselves against.

434
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,707
Sounds like she sets a high standard.

435
00:48:20,707 --> 00:48:25,321
Ugh, you have no idea.
She's my mother.

436
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:27,200
I should be on my way.

437
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,291
Aloy…!

438
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,520
Before you make the journey to Mother's Crown and beyond.

439
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,810
Is there any chance you could search for Sona?

440
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,080
Where was she last seen?

441
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,620
The War Party massacre site.

442
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,256
A wooded hollow across from Devil's Thirst on this side of the river.

443
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,919
You might be able to pick up her trail there.

444
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:47,736
She went after the killers who attacked the Proving.

445
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:49,358
Who killed those we love.

446
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,882
Who tried to kill you…

447
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:54,388
I get it Varl. I'll see what I can do.

448
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,821
[in the distance]
May the Goddess protect!
