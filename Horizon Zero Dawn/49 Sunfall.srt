1
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,135
ALOY: I see the module.

2
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,690
SYLENS: Good. Now be quick.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,000
ALOY: This … this is Hades?

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,250
SYLENS: Aloy, this is not the time.

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,689
ALOY: It's a Metal Devil.

6
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,409
SYLENS: Open the module's casing, now.

7
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,820
SYLENS: ALOY! Do as I say, or all is lost!

8
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:00,766
HADES: Entity has come here?

9
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,540
HADES: Entity miscalculated.

10
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,996
HADES: Entity cannot destroy me, I am beyond its reach.

11
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,334
ALOY: Maybe you are, but this isn't!

12
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,393
HADES: Destroy the entity!

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,550
SYLENS: Rough going, but you survived.

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,849
You knew Hades was there and you send me to him!

15
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,849
I won't deny I risked your life.

16
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,669
But it was the only way.

17
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,639
Now, with the Focus network down we can both get what we want.

18
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,090
Access to the secrets of Zero Dawn.

19
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:39,050
I'm past trusting you with secrets.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,138
Good, that means you're wising up.

21
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,090
Trust is for fools.

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,261
It shifts and crumbles like sand, a poor foundation for any partnership.

23
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,303
But mutual self-interest?

24
00:02:54,303 --> 00:03:00,050
Now that is a solid bedrock upon which you and I
might build a new science of understanding.

25
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,897
We both need answers Aloy.

26
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,985
And thanks to you we're on the verge of grasping them.

27
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,650
At Sunfall we'll speak again.

28
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,867
You miserable…! Damn him!

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,381
If I could toss this Focus and be rid of you Sylens, I would.

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,580
But we both know I need it.

31
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,779
Sunfall it is, and Zero Dawn.

32
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,289
Keep quiet now.

33
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,350
Can stop tensing up.

34
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,899
Come on then!

35
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,072
BANDIT: Here we are!

36
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,289
Right on target.

37
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,779
That's it, nothing to see here.

38
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,360
Not this time, little one.

39
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,334
My Focus is receiving another signal.

40
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,598
There it is, another Tallneck.

41
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,069
Calm, calm.

42
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,912
Okay, I need to get up to the Tallneck's head.

43
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,049
Got their attention!

44
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,759
This storm's gonna back down before I do.

45
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,759
They're scanning for me.

46
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,349
SHADOW CARJA: Not making this easy…

47
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,328
SHADOW CARJA: They've scurried away, watch me.

48
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,617
ALOY: This might even the odds.

49
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,849
SHADOW CARJA: None will stand against us!

50
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,267
ALOY: Another hit in.

51
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,970
Passed the test.

52
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,940
So much for being careful!

53
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,759
I should be able to jump onto the Tallneck from here.

54
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,789
Made it! Now to climb up to its head.

55
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,504
Alright, got what I need.

56
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,545
Scrabbling a bit.

57
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:51,334
Sorry to spoil your fun! 

58
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,841
Huh, nice.

59
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,660
Dust storm blowing in, moves like water.

60
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:30,000
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: Sunfall. The mad King Jiran's summer palace.

61
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,289
SYLENS: A bulwark of Carja might against the howling Forbidden West.

62
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,279
ALOY: Thanks for the history lesson.

63
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,369
SYLENS: But they have no idea what lies beneath.

64
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,549
SYLENS: We will learn much from this, Aloy.

65
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,440
ALOY: That's what I'm hoping.

66
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,383
SHADOW CARJA: The old warriors have stories about
how calm the machines used to be, must've been nice.

67
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:42,002
SHADOW CARJA: The ceasefire is baffling. How can we just decide not to strike back against the usurpers?

68
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,219
SHADOW CARJA: I know we're here for a reason, but I just miss feeling useful.

69
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:19,491
SHADOW CARJA: He's always been a righteous man.
I never would've thought Uthid capable of abandoning us like this.

70
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,000
MERCHANT: Buy what you need, leave the rest.

71
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,349
MERCHANT: Don't pass up these goods.

72
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,349
MERCHANT: Would you like to buy something today?

73
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,458
MERCHANT: You won't find better wares!

74
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,460
MERCHANT: I got all the best goods here.

75
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,829
MERCHANT: Take a look at these wares.

76
00:36:57,421 --> 00:37:01,880
SYLENS: The Sun Ring. A proud tradition of the Carja.

77
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,138
ALOY: It's not like this in Meridian. At least, not any more.

78
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,000
SYLENS: Give them time, I'm sure they'll miss it.

79
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,840
SYLENS: Now we get to see if your attack
on their Focus network was entirely successful.

80
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,856
ALOY: What are you talking about? Did I crash the network or not?

81
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,458
SYLENS: In theory, all should be well.

82
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:28,889
ALOY: Hmph.

83
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,046
SYLENS: Success! Welcome to the Citadel, Aloy.

84
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,203
SYLENS: I'll check back with you in a moment.

85
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:59,579
SYLENS: In the meantime, circulate.

86
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,557
CRIER: Outlanders! If you want to hear about today's bounties,
head for the throne room.

87
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:37,498
CRIER: You're not going to make any shards by standing out here.

88
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,578
CRIER: Filthy mercenary bottom feeders.

89
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,949
ELKEND: I'll take the shards, even if it means having to listen to Bahavas.

90
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:03,117
MERCENARY: I hear the Shadow Carja are looking for one of their own.
Should pay well.

91
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:08,508
SHADOW CARJA: …cease fire, let's be generous, a month.

92
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,829
BAHAVAS: By the glory of the Sun revealed!

93
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,329
Behold, Radiant Itamen! The one true Sun-King.

94
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:31,559
The light in shadow, whose will is light and whose light is law!

95
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,030
I command Lucent Bahavas to speak on my behalf.

96
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:48,711
By the will of Radiant Itamen does the Sun
glare down mercilessly upon the traitor Uthid.

97
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:55,059
BAHAVAS: To the hunter who brings his head to us,
shall go a bounty of 500 shards.

98
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,823
VANASHA: More prisoners than royalty, don't you think?
BAHAVAS: The crimes of the traitor Uthid are many and so…

99
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:04,438
VANASHA: Hmm, love your hair.
BAHAVAS: …provoke the ire of the Sun in full blaze!
Not only did the wretch conspire to…

100
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:07,483
VANASHA: You and I need to chat, little huntress.
BAHAVAS: …infiltrate the Citadel and assassinate…

101
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:11,395
VANASHA: The green tent down in Shadowside, I'll be waiting.
BAHAVAS: …the one true king, but he refused to surrender when…

102
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:13,267
ALOY: Uh, kinda busy.
BAHAVAS: …discovered and fled…

103
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:17,279
BAHAVAS: …and in doing so demonstrated wanton disregard for…

104
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:20,110
VANASHA: We both know you're no killer for hire.
BAHAVAS:  …the safety of the king's subjects.

105
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,630
VANASHA: Uthid is innocent.

106
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,987
VANASHA: So come see me while there's still time to save him.
BAHAVAS: Go forth then, outlanders, and do the will of the Sun!

107
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:31,922
SYLENS: So, the way in I spoke of his right behind you.

108
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,993
ALOY: You've gotta be kidding.

109
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:34,967
SYLENS: Not at all.

110
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,838
ODUND: Got to see the Sun Ring from on high!

111
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,849
ELKEND: But the Kestrels…?

112
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:45,056
ODUND: They want us to see this, boy. It makes quite an impression.

113
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,079
SHADOW CARJA: Another savage? At least it's not as bad as Meridian.

114
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,570
Nora, you have the mark of a Seeker.

115
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,050
It's more complicated than that.

116
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,630
I'm an outcast, like you.

117
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:01,298
Yes. I'm Yun, these are The Shunned.

118
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,260
We'll take any job, but hunting our hated tribe? That's for free.

119
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,730
Keep that in mind.

120
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,590
Why did they cast you out?

121
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,369
Murder, you?

122
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,019
Mmm, birth.

123
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,309
Huh.

124
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:17,421
SHADOW CARJA: Outlanders are idiots. But perhaps they're useful idiots.

125
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,070
You're not known to Kikuk's Killers.

126
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,210
Have any songs been written about you?

127
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,360
Uuh, maybe. How about you?

128
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:31,088
Only laments. We're the enders of songs.

129
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,108
Machine speared or man's spark.

130
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,909
We stop them all.

131
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,934
Ah, charming.

132
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:38,708
Warmth is for weakness.

133
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,027
SHADOW CARJA: Word is that the outlanders
are only here to weed out traitors, so at least I'm safe.

134
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:51,154
SHADOW CARJA: I tell you for a little more food,
I'd do whatever work these outlanders are doing and more.

135
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:01,648
SHADOW CARJA: Strange, I used to walk by
the same old man every morning, but I haven't seen him today.

136
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:09,829
ODUND: If you're gonna watch some slaughter, this is the place to do it!

137
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,659
ELKEND: I don't like heights.

138
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,530
ODUND: You worry me, boy, you worry me.

139
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,110
ELKEND: If you've got a problem with me talk to Odund, if you can stand his breath.

140
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:30,700
Another man hunt. How many men and women can one tribe lose?

141
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,536
Odund, leader of Odund's Marvels.

142
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,732
You've a fresh face.

143
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:40,219
When you're less and eye or an ear or two you'll fit right in.

144
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,893
First impressions make the sale, except in this snakepit.

145
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,920
They'll take whoever shows up.

146
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:51,034
This isn't your first job for the Shadow Carja?

147
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:54,378
Scared of their own shadows Carja more like.

148
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:57,116
They spit on me, but the shards are good.

149
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,763
Look at those nobles.

150
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:05,233
I say noble, but you can't dress a rat in silk and call it a Rat King, can you?

151
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:11,667
Sunfall is a house of clay, if you were to stamp your foot it would all crumble.

152
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:14,219
Shouldn't you all be setting out to hunt Uthid?

153
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,460
Have you never done this before?

154
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,340
Whoever goes first just leads the others.

155
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,869
Just take a load off and avail yourself
of some Carja booze until someone sniffs out the trail.

156
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,010
Then watch us seek out our prey, straight as a Ravager's shot. Zip!

157
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:35,834
Are you sure you're gonna be able to walk in a straight line?

158
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:38,719
W–w–what are you getting at?

159
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,420
Do you think Uthid did what they're accusing him of?

160
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:45,000
I hope so, it'll make him more dangerous.

161
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,934
My advice? It's best not to overthink such things.

162
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:52,167
Uh, overthink whether he's guilty or innocent?

163
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:57,750
Haha, you let all these thoughts in your head, you'll never make it as a mercenary.

164
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,380
Only thing that matters is dead or alive.

165
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,144
If they say alive, bring a rag to stuff in its mouth.

166
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,600
But these days, no one wants alive.

167
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,063
Farewell Odund.

168
00:44:11,063 --> 00:44:12,849
Good hunting!

169
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:17,000
If I should have cause to kill you, you won't suffer.

170
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,250
Oh, thanks.

171
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,677
SHADOW CARJA: Sun in shadow, if you can't trust Uthid, who can you trust?

172
00:44:57,077 --> 00:45:01,996
SHADOW CARJA: Is the cease fire gonna put
more food on our table? I very much doubt it.

173
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:16,151
SHADOW CARJA: Nice to have a break. Work's been hard lately.

174
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,300
SHADOW CARJA: I saw a kestrel talking—

175
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,458
The food is from Dowager Queen Nasadi little ones.

176
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,099
Her Highness knows times are hard and helps when she can.

177
00:45:55,389 --> 00:46:00,196
Eat, but bring some home for your families, if you have one.

178
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,368
I've heard whispers about you.

179
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:11,289
Rides machines, fancy spear, delightful freckles.

180
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:16,394
Some even say you have a conscience, how extraordinary!

181
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,399
Who are you? You're obviously not one of the Shadow Carja.

182
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,090
My name is Vanasha.

183
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:31,278
For now, all you need to know is that
I'm a whisper of reason in this howling pit of insanity.

184
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,440
Stop being evasive and tell me who you really are.

185
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,489
Stop being evasive? You might as well tell me to stop being charming.

186
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:43,559
It's impossible, but I like you so I'll tell you a secret.

187
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,558
I have friends in Meridian and I like to do favours for them when I can.

188
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,000
Uthid might be of use to them.

189
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,280
He's a good man, so naturally the Shadow Carja wanna murder him.

190
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,920
I've done some digging and I think he's headed for the Greenclimb.

191
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:01,010
It won't take those mercenaries long to find him.

192
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:05,600
He could use some help if you're so inclined.

193
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,750
What makes you think he's on the Greenclimb?

194
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,598
He knows he'll be pursued.

195
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,548
So he needs a hideout that's both familiar and defensible.

196
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:17,878
He once single-handedly held off an entire bandit clan in those foothills.

197
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,949
My guess is that he'll fall back on what worked before.

198
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,090
How do you know Uthid is innocent?

199
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,139
I'm excellent at making enquiries.

200
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:33,699
Look, he feeds orphans from his own rations
and personally punishes anyone who hurts the old or infirm.

201
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:38,210
The idea that he would try to kill Itamen is ridiculous.

202
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:41,478
He must have found something that can embarrass the priesthood.

203
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,590
Otherwise Bahavas wouldn't risk marking such a well-regarded man for death.

204
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,250
I'll do what I can for Uthid, but what about you?

205
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,969
What about me, what?

206
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,019
What will you do while I risk my life?

207
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:56,289
Useful things, little huntress.

208
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,838
Look for three dead trees south of Sunfall.

209
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,730
They mark the start of the Greenclimb. Good luck.

210
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:16,300
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

211
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,809
Three dead trees, just like Vanasha said.

212
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:41,900
Let's see if Uthid came through here.

213
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,289
The tracks stop here, time to climb.

214
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,619
Alright, made it. Where did you go Uthid?

215
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,522
Food scraps. I'll bet Uthid stopped to see if he was being followed.

216
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:54,203
He must have kept going, I've got to catch up.
