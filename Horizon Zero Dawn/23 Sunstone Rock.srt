1
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,070
Got one.

2
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,350
You'll do.

3
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,349
Fresh as it comes.

4
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,849
Down you go!

5
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,550
Can stop tensing up.

6
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,740
That should be enough fluid.

7
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,199
These things are hard to catch.

8
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,250
Stay down!

9
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,850
Save these for the trail.

10
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,350
[Bandit thug]
She's coming for us!

11
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,880
[Bandit thug]
It's killing time!

12
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,419
[Bandit thug]
I'll finish you!

13
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,159
[Bandit thug]
Got another shot for ya!

14
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,564
[Bandit thug]
Wanna play? Here's your invitation.

15
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,360
Forget about travelling light.

16
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,350
Rain. Ah well, I'm mostly waterproof.

17
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,110
Okay, alarm's down.

18
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,849
Still sniffing around.

19
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,500
They've taken those travellers captive.

20
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,099
I'll get this open, hold on.

21
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,660
It's all right, I'm getting you out.

22
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,079
Got too much already.

23
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,349
[Carja guard]
We need warriors like her, ready to stand up for the Sundom.

24
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,384
[Carja outlander]
She didn't even hesistate…

25
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,316
[Carja outlander]
That crazy Oseram tried to kill our Sun-King,
but the machine rider stopped him.

26
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:09,008
[Carja outlander]
Lucky that the Nora was there to protect the Sun-King.

27
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:11,264
[Carja outlander]
What on earth were the Vanguard doing?

28
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,549
[Carja guard]
We will never be able to repay you for the life of our Sun-King.

29
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:52,074
[Carja guard]
Just because he failed to kill the Sun-King,
doesn't mean he's any less guilty. He should pay.

30
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,259
Can't be too prepared.

31
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,172
This must be Sunstone Rock.

32
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,500
It's being attacked by machines!

33
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,849
[Carja guard]
I don't like our chances!

34
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,180
[Carja guard]
You wanna tell Warden Janeva we backed down?

35
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,990
[Carja guard]
Let's take our chances!

36
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:26,379
[Carja guard]
Victory is ours.

37
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,379
[Carja guard]
You pulled us out of a tough spot, outlander.

38
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:32,709
[Carja guard]
Welcome to Sunstone Rock.

39
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,680
[Carja guard]
You should speak to Warden Janeva, inside.

40
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,049
[Carja guard]
We have won.

41
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:03,859
[Carja archer]
By the Sun, it's over.

42
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,678
[Carja guard]
It was a machine lure.

43
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,349
[Carja guard]
We don't know how they got it.

44
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,685
[Warden Janeva]
Rasgrund concealed the parts on his person, no doubt.

45
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,891
[Carja guard]
We searched him. How…?

46
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,250
[Warden Janeva]
You don't want to know how.

47
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,645
[Carja guard]
Always stay bright, always stay alert. That's what I say.

48
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:35,349
Warden Janeva, this is the one who defeated the Behemoths.

49
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Outlander, I'm impressed. I don't impress easily.

50
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,128
Tell me, how do you fare with hunting living prey?

51
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,789
Haven't had any complaints. Why?

52
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,448
Three dangerous prisoners have escaped.

53
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:51,650
I need my men here getting the others back in line.

54
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,159
None of this would have happened
if we dealt with criminals the old way.

55
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,778
But I've clashed that gong before.

56
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,178
And here I am.

57
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,800
And here you are.

58
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,534
What's the old way?

59
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:05,840
To be buried up to the neck and left for the Sun's judgement.

60
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,570
Seems to me like the judgment's already been made.

61
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,328
Not one of them committed another crime.

62
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,110
So the Carja keep their criminals in this place?

63
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,044
Since the liberation.

64
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:20,234
We've had them all from thieves
to the mad King Jiran's former Kestrels.

65
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:22,988
The Sun-King believes in the power of change.

66
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,575
And sure enough, some did change.

67
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,260
Shed their skin, like lizards.

68
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,718
I thought all criminals were the same once.

69
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,932
That's why the Sun-King gave me command of Sunstone Rock.

70
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,150
As an education.

71
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,668
Sounds like an honour.

72
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,042
I mean, I haven't seen any other women in Carja armour…

73
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,518
No, I'm not one of your sisters.

74
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,838
No woman can wear Carja armour.

75
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,630
When I was young, I chose to become a soldier.

76
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,900
One good enough to join Avad's honour guard.

77
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,948
There was talk about what I was.

78
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:57,815
So I'd say "Test me, then I'll break your arm".

79
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:02,639
After enough arms had been broken there was less talk.

80
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,139
I'm curious, but I'd rather we didn't have to start fighting.

81
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,118
Agreed.

82
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,329
So you want these prisoners brought back?

83
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:12,030
No, I want them put in the earth.

84
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,009
I doubt they'll give you any choice.

85
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,728
They had their chance with the Sun-King's generosity.

86
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,729
So now they face mine.

87
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:21,509
A bounty on all their heads.

88
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,829
Who are these dangerous prisoners?

89
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,228
Three from the isolation cages.

90
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,528
Don't feel sorry for them.

91
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,349
They've lived well off the Sun-King's conscience.

92
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,828
First, is Rasgrund. Oseram trap maker, hates the Carja.

93
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,468
Crazy as a loon in heat.

94
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:39,969
Caught in one too many blasts, or one too few.

95
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,841
Then there's Ullia, a Tenakth warrior,
if that means anything to you.

96
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:47,440
Not really, another tribe?

97
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,148
Reavers from the south, bloodthirsty.

98
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,329
Some say they're cannibals, but she slurped gruel well enough.

99
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:00,808
And the last is Gavan,
a traitor who smuggled weapons to the exiles.

100
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:03,718
Compared to the other two, this one doesn't seem so bad.

101
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,808
He helped drag out a civil war.

102
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,948
All for the shards it got him.

103
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,110
A machine has more warmth.

104
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,190
If I did this for you, I'd need a lead on them.

105
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,238
Well, when Ullia first swept through the Sundom,
it was with the jungle bandits.

106
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,858
I say she'll go back.

107
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,782
Rasgrund we pulled out of a crack in Dusk Mesa,
where he'd been tinkering with his bombs.

108
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:28,175
And Gavan will be trying to pay his way across the lake.

109
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,869
I'd burn my palm on it.

110
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,440
Look in Brightmarket.

111
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,420
Need them soon enough.

112
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,030
Okay, I already got rid of the bandits.

113
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,409
I don't think it'll be hard to find this warrior.

114
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:08,210
[Ullia]
I told you they would come. Drive her into the dirt!

115
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:32,500
No way we could have talked about this, huh?

116
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,688
All the Carja did was talk.

117
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,010
Talk and bleed, and talk and shackle me.

118
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,642
But you? You fought like a Tenakth.

119
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:44,300
I'd have taken you for my child.

120
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,148
You can't just take a child.

121
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:52,125
The strong take from the weak,
and in the taking are made stronger.

122
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,088
These stories, pricked into my skin.

123
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,299
Look!

124
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,718
Children, riches, lives, and land.

125
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,838
All of these have been mine.

126
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,590
Drink of my [cough] my blood and I'll live on.

127
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,360
No, Ullia.

128
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,929
I've got enough stories to carry.

129
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,178
[Carja guard]
Did she really save the Sun-King? A Nora?

130
00:46:55,574 --> 00:46:57,587
[Carja villager]
The Sundom's grown too soft.

131
00:46:57,587 --> 00:47:00,231
[Carja villager]
Too much Oseram influence at the palace.

132
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,347
[Carja villager]
What's he thinking letting Dervahl live?
