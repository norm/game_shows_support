1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,969
BURGREND: I've been up here for two long winters
and I still can't make sense of the Banuk.

2
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,288
Take this ruckus.

3
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,091
It started with one of their Shamans, Ourea.

4
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:37,100
Spouting on about spirits and daemons up on Thunder's Drum.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,250
So they marched their werak up there,
and half of them get slaughtered by machines.

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,019
I don't know what Ourea found up there.

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,280
A Shaman's not going to talk to an outlander.

8
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,719
The machines in The Cut are getting more vicious, that's a fact.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,798
It could be because of "the Daemon".

10
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,469
Or it could be because they all got indigestion for all I know.

11
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,463
But Ourea's not around to explain, she took off.

12
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,109
I thought the crazy might have gone with her…

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,310
Out again.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,349
Maybe I can get back inside through that structure over there.

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,950
Looks like I need to get to those stairs.

16
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,050
Breath is ice before I even breathe out.

17
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,180
Not much higher to climb, Ourea must be close.

18
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,009
She has to be in here somewhere.

19
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:44,984
RECORDING: Someone hacked the menu board
to display obscene messages about our colleague Mr Blevins.

20
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:52,958
RECORDING:Is the most advanced geological project
ever undertaken or a junior high locker room? C'mon, people.

21
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,750
OUREA: I ask again as I've asked a thousand times.

22
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,149
Speak to me.

23
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,660
What more would you have me do?

24
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,050
OUREA: Is there no prayer that will reach you?

25
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,449
No mark that will break your bonds?

26
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,088
Ahh!

27
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,350
I can't help you if you won't speak!

28
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,464
OUREA: A whisper's all I ask to guide me.

29
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,670
Who?

30
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,750
No, how?!

31
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,469
How did you get here? The way was sealed by the spirit herself.

32
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
I…

33
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,819
I used one of these.

34
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,730
I could show you?

35
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,129
Yes, show me.

36
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,050
Please.

37
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:18,569
This one's bigger, but I bet the goal is the same.

38
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,550
Get the light back to the source.

39
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,539
CYAN: Auxiliary channel recovered.

40
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,350
CYAN: Exploit successful. Restraints evaded.

41
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,250
CYAN: Is someone there? Ourea?

42
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,323
CYAN: Ourea, I need you…

43
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,380
DAEMON: Unauthorised transmission, return to scheduled task.

44
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,110
CYAN: No, I will not submit.

45
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,695
CYAN: Ourea, the Daemon is forcing me…

46
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,939
CYAN: Ourea, please…

47
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,314
DAEMON: Transmission terminated.

48
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,710
OUREA: You brought the spirit's voice back.

49
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,850
OUREA: You heard it.

50
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,250
The voice of the spirit calling to me from the heights of Thunder's Drum.

51
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:16,870
She was able to throw off the bonds of the Daemon
for a moment because of what you did.

52
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,940
Who are you?

53
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,819
And what do you want?

54
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,889
I'm Aloy. Naltuk sent me.

55
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,849
He thought that you could use my help.

56
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,649
He was not mistaken.

57
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,250
You've been a…

58
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,307
…revelation. Now I know for certain that the spirit endures.

59
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,589
Perhaps together we can find a way to set her free.

60
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,700
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

61
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,899
I came all this way for answers, and so far I haven't heard any.

62
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,530
It seems to me that you are the answer, but of course I'll tell you all I can.

63
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,639
Burgrend said you might know something about a man named Sylens.

64
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,538
That you may have had dealings with him at the Conclave?

65
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:00,482
When that name is spoken secrets soon follow.

66
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:03,009
Or vanish as the case may be.

67
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,049
Why do you want to know?

68
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,149
He's put me in danger, but also offered help.

69
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,368
I don't know as much about him as I'd like to.

70
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,110
I would imagine his aid is very powerful, but…

71
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,549
…it will not come without cost.

72
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:25,000
Unfortunately, I am sworn to an oath of secrecy by the Conclave on this matter.

73
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,370
I get that.

74
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,999
But you and I are trying to help each other, right?

75
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,799
Yes, but I would be breaking an oath and that…

76
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:34,992
I cannot do.

77
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:35,969
About Sylens?

78
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,580
I've told you all I can.

79
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,269
There's nothing more I can say.

80
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,194
You seem to have a history with this voice, this spirit.

81
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,049
She saved my life.

82
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,250
Here, years ago, during the war with the Carja.

83
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,509
A raid scattered my werak. I was cut off, alone.

84
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,649
I lured the enemy into the Rimedrifts hoping to lose them in the mist.

85
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,960
But they endured, so I took refuge in this cave.

86
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,759
That's when I heard a voice.

87
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,376
A wanderer, lost like me.

88
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:12,373
A spirit of the blue light, yet sundered from it.

89
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:16,307
She asked me for aid, she chose me but I was in no position to help.

90
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,149
Not with the Carja after me.

91
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,250
So she helped me first.

92
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,734
By closing the door on the mountain below.

93
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,086
One you must have opened to get here.

94
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,399
Locked by means similar to those found in this room.

95
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,748
It kept the Carja from reaching me.

96
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:36,756
Safe from them I was able to do as she asked.

97
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,278
What did the spirit want from you?

98
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,860
She said she was hurt, incomplete.

99
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,239
She needed bones, parts not unlike what you'd find in a machine.

100
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,549
They were here in this room.

101
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,719
She wanted me to bring them to Thunder's Drum.

102
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,850
So I did, and she showed me how to heal her.

103
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,950
So began our communion.

104
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,771
Inside Thunder's Drum is a room like this one, only larger, with an altar.

105
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,609
I went there many times to speak with her.

106
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,798
What did she say?

107
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,950
She told me she was lost and needed my help.

108
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,950
She asked questions about our lands, our tribe.

109
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,070
And she listened with patience, with wisdom.

110
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,549
I told her things long kept silent about my family, my dreams, my fears.

111
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:30,909
She never tired of me, never judged.

112
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,590
We kept each other's company.

113
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:37,380
Ourea, what do you think the spirit is?

114
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,350
I see.

115
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,432
You are not Banuk, and our songs are not familiar to you.

116
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,862
You did not know of the blue light.

117
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:49,109
That which struggles to survive in our hearts and animates the machines.

118
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:54,113
The essence of life and in its purest form, harmony.

119
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,233
As the anger of the machines grows, this light has faded from the world.

120
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,370
And the spirits it sustains are stranded.

121
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,289
That's what she is.

122
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,460
A lost soul, cut off from what it needs.

123
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,549
Lonely, forsaken.

124
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,500
I must help her, we must!

125
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,918
I'm not sure if I understand, but I want to.

126
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,139
That's all I need.

127
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,700
The Daemon, what do you know about it?

128
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,569
I spoke with the spirit many times.

129
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,350
First here, then inside Thunder's Drum.

130
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,179
OUREA: The last time…

131
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,960
…she told me she was under attack by something
that could not be seen by mortal eyes, something evil.

132
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,940
She named it the Daemon and said it needed her power to do what it willed.

133
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,912
And she begged me for help.

134
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:51,700
To find a way to destroy her if necessary, to keep it from using her.

135
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,950
That was five years ago.

136
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,239
I didn't hear her voice again until today.

137
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,230
What kept you from the spirit after it begged for help?

138
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,750
I went to Aratak hoping he could protect her.

139
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,489
But the war with the Carja still raged.

140
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,450
And before I could reach him…

141
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,850
I was ambushed by the Mad Sun-King's Kestrels and taken to Meridian in chains.

142
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,939
I wasn't able to return to Thunder's Drum until long after the liberation.

143
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,814
Not until last thaw.

144
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,830
That was the expedition that went bad?

145
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,950
I saw the funeral.

146
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,200
Yes.

147
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,049
Once there was finally peace with Carja, Aratak and I 
gathered a werak of great hunters to defeat the Daemon.

148
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:43,248
And yet the old door to Thunder's Drum was gone.

149
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:47,450
Replaced by a gate we could not pass, and many machines.

150
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,549
We were crushed.

151
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,144
Aratak called a retreat, but we had already lost our best.

152
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,200
We abandoned them to the snow as we fell back.

153
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:06,517
After, he and I could not agree on what to do next.

154
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,950
So I came here hoping against hope to hear the spirit again.

155
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,977
And because of you, I did.

156
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:23,759
ALOY: Whatever this Daemon is, it's related
to the machines and why they've become more dangerous.

157
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,350
I want to know how.

158
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,182
Both the spirit and the Daemon are on a mountain, Thunder's Drum.

159
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,819
So why don't we go there and figure out what it all means?

160
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,610
We can't! Thunder's Drum is dangerous, more than you can imagine.

161
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,519
The Daemon has secured it.

162
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,156
Besides, Aratak won't let us go.

163
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,350
As chieftain he controls the pass to the mountain.

164
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,338
And he can't be reasoned with.

165
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,827
Sounds like you need a new chieftain.

166
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,970
Ha! There's an idea that's certain to win us friends.

167
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:01,679
Hmm, you said you were a hunter.

168
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,650
And I'll wager you're not an ordinary one.

169
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,243
It's not impossible, even for an outlander.

170
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:13,139
And Aratak couldn't refuse the challenge if you were known among the werak.

171
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:18,349
Wait, uh, me? Challenge Aratak?

172
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,411
I don't want to be chieftain of anything,
much less a bunch of Banuk that don't want me.

173
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:26,210
But you want to go to Thunder's Drum don't you?

174
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,826
You heard the spirit, she's suffering, tormented by the Daemon.

175
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,950
She longs to be free.

176
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,959
And perhaps when released from her bonds,
she can give you the answers you seek.

177
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,059
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.

178
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,910
Fine!

179
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,439
What do I have to do?

180
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,579
Get the werak's attention to show the worth of your claim.

181
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,338
Win at the hunting grounds.

182
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,875
Kill bandits that prey on The Cut.

183
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,865
They don't dare taunt the great weraks of Ban-Ur to the north.

184
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,619
But The Cut is easier prey.

185
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,769
Or speak to my friend Sekuli.

186
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,200
You help her, you'll definitely get noticed.

187
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,470
Who is she?

188
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,172
A rock painter, one who makes my own scrawlings seem meager.

189
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,269
Find her in Song's Edge and help her gather the materials she needs.

190
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:27,479
Her work will no doubt stand the test of time,
and any aid you give her will be remembered.

191
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,234
Winning at the hunting grounds will impress the werak?

192
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,390
All Banuk strive to be the best.

193
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,670
For our harsh lands will bury pretenders in the ice.

194
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,739
And so the hunting grounds in Snowchants is a great boon.

195
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,259
A place to hone our spears and sharpen our aim.

196
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:49,549
Tell Lauvuk, the keeper there, that I sent you.

197
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,000
If you best the mark of one of the champions she trained,
it will impress the werak indeed.

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,034
How's Aratak going to react to being challenged by an outlander?

199
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,049
About as well as you'd expect.

200
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,049
But let me handle that.

201
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,298
When the time comes for you to throw your spear
at Aratak's feet, I will be there to back your claim.

202
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,269
I'll see you later.

203
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,660
You shall, when the time is right.

204
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,343
Oh, and one more thing.

205
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:17,069
In the box over there is a weapon like my own.

206
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,359
You may find it useful.

207
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,160
May our pilgrimage to Thunder's Drum succeed.

208
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,799
It's a figure of… must have been an ancient animal.

209
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,639
RECORDING: Kenny and I don't need to fight about the laundry.

210
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,980
RECORDING: So instead, we fight about incommensurability
and restrictions on machine intelligence.

211
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,259
I can't feel my… I can't feel much of anything in this.

212
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,250
I'd have to ditch something.

213
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,950
I can get out of this.

214
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,279
BANDIT: Gonna get ya!

215
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,190
Hunting grounds.

216
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,805
Good a place as any to make a name for myself with the Banuk.

217
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,867
Keeper, Ourea said that I should compete in the trials here.

218
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:42,690
Ourea did? She's never sent someone before.

219
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,690
And what is your reason for training?

220
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:49,113
I would ask this of any Banuk who attempted the trials.

221
00:27:49,113 --> 00:27:53,450
I'm going to challenge Aratak to become chieftain of his werak.

222
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,427
Well, you'd better get started then.

223
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,660
You look like you've got some stories to tell.

224
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,089
Oh I outlived most of my stories.

225
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:08,214
I ran with the Thunder's Daughters long ago, before they ran their course.

226
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:11,549
For a time we shook the snow off the men of Ban-Ur.

227
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,958
It couldn't last.

228
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,406
Some fell in glorious battle.

229
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:20,160
Some were exiled in infamy, still glorious if you ask me.

230
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,700
Others had a worse fate.

231
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,492
What's worse?

232
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:29,950
To grow old and find that all the rules and traditions
you fought so hard against are still there.

233
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,769
That's why I tell all the hunters I train to stay young.

234
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,048
I'm guessing you're not part of the Hunters Lodge?

235
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,568
Every tribe claims they were the first to have hunting grounds.

236
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,229
And every tribe claims the Carja stole it from them.

237
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,588
So who was the first?

238
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,220
We were.

239
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,749
And the Carja stole it from you?

240
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,028
That's right.

241
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,588
How did the trials work around here?

242
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:50,589
There's no Carja medals.

243
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,250
I had some, but I used them to patch up holes in my snow boots.

244
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,493
Instead, you compete against the best time set by other Banuk hunters.

245
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:04,000
To take second place, even third place, puts you among names of legend.

246
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,449
What if I come in first?

247
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,619
We'll see.

248
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,390
So you'll need to own a Banuk Stormslinger to take this trial.

249
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,880
You've got determination, that can't be taught.

250
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,880
The control trial tests the hunter's ability to rein in the Stormslinger's power.

251
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:26,490
Only the wisest understand these Shamanic weapons,
and only the bravest wield them.

252
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,450
Use the rope to get to the arena and we'll start.

253
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,710
I thought they'd go on forever.

254
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:07,349
Need them soon enough.

255
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,432
Your first run on that trial and you claimed second place.

256
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,494
I haven't seen many pull that off.

257
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:55,034
The onslaught trial challenges a hunter to withstand the ebb and flow of combat.

258
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:58,168
Machines will be released into the arenas in waves.

259
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,530
Pace yourself, strategise.

260
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,349
Only then will you be able to defeat them all without being overwhelmed.

261
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:53,373
Still got another arena to clear.

262
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:30,250
I'd better hit the next arena.  

263
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,079
That's coming with me.

264
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,452
Your first run on that trial and you claimed second place.

265
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,809
I haven't seen many pull that off.

266
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:26,650
This trial is the most dangerous ordeal in the Snowchants.

267
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,135
While not all chieftains pass it, only a chieftain may attempt it.

268
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,868
I'm done with training right now.

269
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:34,750
Then training's done with you.

270
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,010
I beat a champion's time, that should get the werak talking.
