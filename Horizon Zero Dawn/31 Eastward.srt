1
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,049
The snow's got a bite out here.

2
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,769
Now they're hunting me.

3
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,250
[Carja villager]
We're letting the…

4
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,939
[Carja villager]
…Oseram decide what to do with him?

5
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,649
[Carja villager]
But he tried to kill our Sun-King!

6
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,723
[Carja outlander]
It was Dervahl…

7
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,368
I'm gonna need you.

8
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,320
That wasn't a warning.

9
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,119
It's a clever trick they have, but no need to see what you can scent.

10
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,370
This blood is sharp, huntress, flint-sharp!

11
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:51,162
[laughs]

12
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:58,149
The last time I took it in to me,
they say I slept the sleep of death and sweated dark oil.

13
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,059
Alright, try not to die.

14
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,049
A Stalker, watching us!

15
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,225
Watched by us.

16
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:17,664
In red eyes, I thought to see ourselves reflected.

17
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:22,026
No, they were dull and set.

18
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:27,230
Set with a purpose precise from their machine-mother foundries.

19
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,158
They prey.

20
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,038
They will not flinch.

21
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,220
They are indifferent to the wild. They are … final.

22
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,575
They are weapons, that's all.

23
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:40,649
My heart drops.

24
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,750
Why look for understanding in the axe the moment before it splits your skull?

25
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,012
No. No, no, no, no, no, there's more.

26
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:53,559
The axe does not remember its smelting.

27
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,009
These machines do, and pine for the Metal World.

28
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,679
It's hard to know what to make of you.

29
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,272
Then open my mouth and look inside!

30
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,313
[laughs]

31
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:12,850
A cave of echoes and memory, but not my own.

32
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,486
I mean, you're tough skinned, I'll give you that.

33
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,679
Especially on the inside.

34
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,908
I first drank at the spring of a fallen Thunderjaw.

35
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,339
The cables cried out like water birds.

36
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,239
But felling giants is short work for you.

37
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,070
Trying to appeal to my pride?

38
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,350
No.

39
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,677
To inevitability, huntress.

40
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:40,489
The tremor of their tread, can you feel it?

41
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,370
Tugging you to the Eastern Valleys?

42
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:45,679
So a Thunderjaw next, huh?

43
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,663
But of course.

44
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:50,441
Go where the hunt takes you, but…

45
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,770
[laughs]

46
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,536
…let the blood lead you back.

47
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:16,000
You're coming with me.

48
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,970
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

49
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:31,980
Whenever a machine falls, a Scrapper won't be far.

50
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,569
Makes this a little easier.

51
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,047
Here they come.

52
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,049
[Carja merchant]
…what do with him, but he tried to kill our Sun-King!

53
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,769
[Carja artisan]
The Oseram have gone too far this time. Dervahl…

54
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,190
[Carja merchant]
You'll like what I have for sale, I promise.

55
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:47,434
You're back.

56
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:50,319
I've gotten some reports, so I have a notion of what you're gonna say.

57
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:55,210
That your man Zaid was running a slaving operation right under your nose?

58
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,929
He was never my man, but I won't make excuses.

59
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,279
I should've dug harder for proof of his guilt.

60
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,839
There'll be a full investigation.

61
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,990
If you see this young woman again, assure her she'll face no reprisal.

62
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:11,759
And please offer her my personal apology.

63
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,589
Do you really think that will help her?

64
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,009
No, I don't suppose it will.

65
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,849
But for every shadow there's some light.

66
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,569
I hope you'll see that one day.

67
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,873
[Carja merchant]
Take a look at these wares.

68
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:28,948
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

69
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,511
[Carja artisan]
She was incredible, stopped Dervahl without breaking a sweat.

70
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:36,690
[Oseram trader]
Nothing but trouble, that's all there is in Banuk lands.

71
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,869
I heard you talking about trouble in Banuk lands.

72
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,870
Was that out loud?

73
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,670
Ears must be getting worn down from all those Longleg blasts.

74
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,318
But you heard right.

75
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,909
I'm fresh back from The Cut looking for better scavenging and better shards.

76
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,681
I guess you didn't find them up there?

77
00:30:53,681 --> 00:31:00,049
Not with the Banuk wailing about new machines,
and talking spirits, and their purses frozen shut.

78
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:05,038
What's a trade route without trade? It's just a route.

79
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,569
There's a trade route?

80
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,528
I thought the Banuk kept to themselves.

81
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:12,028
We Oseram and the Banuk are neighbours after all.

82
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:14,660
What's a few mountain ranges between friends?

83
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,700
I have some acquaintances out there, 
still trying to dig a living out of the ice, but they say nothing seems to stick.

84
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,079
All the superstitious nonsense and rampaging machines aren't helping.

85
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,699
What were these new machines and spirits?

86
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,789
Honestly, I don't even know.

87
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,890
Going by the number of Banuk funerals I'd say the kind you turn away from.

88
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,458
Not really my style.

89
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:41,729
Well, if you reach my grand old age, you might prefer
picking up after hunters in the Sundom.

90
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:43,150
It's warmer too.

91
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,434
What is this place, "The Cut"?

92
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:51,798
When the Carja took up swords and hacked away
at the edge of Banuk land, they left The Cut behind.

93
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:56,467
So a battleground from the war, like the valley outside the Sacred Land.

94
00:31:56,467 --> 00:32:00,519
Mmm-hmm. Mountain pass in the far north and east will get you there.

95
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,998
It's open to outlanders, hardy ones like you.

96
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:06,949
Just don't expect much of a welcome.

97
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,939
Especially not now.

98
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,499
New machines and talking spirits, I'm interested.

99
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,849
Thought as much just looking at you.

100
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,809
Don't say you weren't warned.

101
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,338
There's a slip of a trail through the North eastern mountains,
past what we call the Grave-Hoard.

102
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,578
You won't miss it.

103
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:27,349
Just keep going up until your skin starts to turn blue.

104
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,450
You'll find what passes for a town on the other side.

105
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,769
Maybe someone there can talk you out of it.

106
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:35,000
Maybe. Maybe not.

107
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,670
Thanks for the information.

108
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:47,759
[Carja guard]
Arrested two for disorderly conduct last night.

109
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,540
[Carja merchant]
You'll like what I have for sale, I promise.

110
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:53,450
[Carja artisan]
I like the sight of…

111
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,204
[whistle]

112
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,849
Ho!

113
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,039
This won't give me trouble anymore.

114
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,750
[Bandit]
We got a stiff over here!

115
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,389
They've taken those travellers captive.

116
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,650
Let's get you out of there.

117
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,150
I'm not leaving you in here.

118
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,269
[Bandit]
We're under attack!

119
00:38:38,978 --> 00:38:40,917
[Bandit heavy]
Death's coming for you…!

120
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,989
[Nora prisoner]
…good night's rest, ready to go out hunting…

121
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,440
Should've brought a cart.

122
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:20,000
[Nora]
Goddess show us mercy. Do not let your faithful children be forgotten.

123
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:52,100
[Nora]
Sitting's underrated if you ask me.

124
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,039
Might need…

125
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,010
[Nora Brave]
Keep them guessing!

126
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:37,224
[Nora Brave]
Please, help me.

127
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:03,229
[Nora Brave]
I need a little help over here.

128
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:12,414
[Nora Brave]
Please, help me.

129
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,000
[Nora Brave]
I'd love to speak with you.

130
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,409
[Nora Brave]
Please come, it'll only take a moment.

131
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:42,409
[Nora Brave]
I'm alive thanks to you. Please, I want you to have this.

132
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:44,887
[Nora Brave]
I wouldn't have made it without you, thank you.

133
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,599
[whistle]

134
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:47,599
[whistle]

135
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,590
Oh, nice!

136
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,310
Always watching.

137
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,090
That was worth it.

138
00:50:04,407 --> 00:50:06,228
Coming down steady as a drumbeat.

139
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,480
Hello!

140
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,382
[whistle]

141
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,900
Nice! To a good hunt.

142
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,250
[Carja outlander]
The only justice Dervahl deserves is at the tip of a spear.

143
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:24,707
[Nora Brave]
All-Mother purify the machines, cleanse them of Corruption!

144
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:35,150
[Nora Brave]
Blasted Carja, the nightmares still keep me awake.

145
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,332
[Oseram trader]
Carja may like this heat, but I sure don't.

146
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,605
[Nora Brave]
My own damn fault, should've got out of there quick.

147
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:44,880
You— you can stay away!

148
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,875
I have no quarrel with the Nora.

149
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,328
And I have no quarrel with you.

150
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:54,630
These trials test a hunter's skill with different ammunition types,
when taking down machines.

151
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,039
Sounds easy enough.

152
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,668
Easy!? What do you know, girl?

153
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,099
I know that for someone who doesn't want to fight a Nora,
you're treading awfully close.

154
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:05,739
Now you know, so you can be on your way.

155
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,934
Wait, what if I wanna have a go at one of these trials?

156
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:11,500
[sighs] Then I have to give them to you.

157
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,739
You're not very friendly, are you?

158
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,449
Oh, and the Nora are? Don't you usually kill trespassers and outlanders?

159
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,840
Is that what you're afraid of?

160
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,148
Look, I didn't choose this assignment.

161
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,840
They told me it was an honour then stuck me right near your Sacred Lands.

162
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,209
So I'm keeping to what I know, herds and trials.

163
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:37,340
And hoping I won't get murdered by Nora angry about the Red Raids.

164
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,634
Just to be clear, I have no plans to murder you, alright?

165
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:43,667
Fine, but I'm watching you.

166
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:49,550
For this trial shoot the containers on Striders backs with fire arrows.

167
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,449
If you hit them right, you'll get quite a blast.

168
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:55,190
Slide down a rope so I can start timing.

169
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:43,334
You won a Blazing Sun on your first try. That's … admirable.

170
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,139
If you can freeze enough machines and take them down, I'll consider it a pass.

171
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,300
Good. I'll start timing when you slide down a rope.

172
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,530
So they woke up.

173
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,530
I've got other ammo.

174
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,440
I think I'm in the clear.

175
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:30,700
You won a Blazing Sun on your first try. That's … admirable.

176
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:40,949
In this trial, you'll need to stun Bellowbacks with shock ammo,
and shoot off the components in their undercarriages.

177
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,309
[Keeper]
Get going.

178
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:18,360
I thought they'd go on forever.

179
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:56,685
Ah, better. No more time to recover.

180
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:25,925
You won a Blazing Sun on your first try. That's … admirable.

181
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,320
I'm not interested in a trial right now.

182
01:05:41,389 --> 01:05:43,500
Just what I wanted to hear.
