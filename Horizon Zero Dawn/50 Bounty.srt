1
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,928
VANASHA: I have friends in Meridian and I like to do favours for them when I can.

2
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,550
VANASHA: Uthid might be of use to them.

3
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,850
VANASHA: He's a good man, so naturally the Shadow Carja wanna murder him.

4
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,639
I've done some digging and I think he's headed for the Greenclimb.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,750
It won't take those mercenaries long to find him.

6
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,189
He could use some help if you're so inclined.

7
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,490
What makes you think he's on the Greenclimb?

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,289
He knows he'll be pursued.

9
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,239
So he needs a hideout that's both familiar and defensible.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,609
He once single-handedly held off an entire bandit clan in those foothills.

11
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,679
My guess is that he'll fall back on what worked before.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,850
How do you know Uthid is innocent?

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,709
Look, he feeds orphans from his own rations,
and personally punishes anyone who hurts the old or infirm.

14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,250
The idea that he would try to kill Itamen is ridiculous.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,518
He must have found something that can embarrass the priesthood.

16
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,650
Otherwise, Bahavas wouldn't risk marking such a well-regarded man for death.

17
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,590
Alright, made it.

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,469
Where did you go Uthid?

19
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,406
Food scraps. I'll bet Uthid stopped to see if he was being followed.

20
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:46,730
He must have kept going, I've got to catch up.

21
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,150
A dead machine. Uthid's been hunting.

22
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,150
Everything useful has been stripped.

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,442
Uthid's been gathering components, and probably for ammo.

24
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:59,541
Glinthawks looking to scavenge.

25
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:52,850
Alright, back to Uthid. Where'd he go from here?

26
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,269
Uthid took down a Ravager. Not an easy kill, but worth it for the parts.

27
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,699
Dead Watchers. More scrap for Uthid's stockpile.

28
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,189
The next one doesn't miss.

29
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,949
Uthid!

30
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,667
You're young for a bounty hunter, or am I old for a soldier?

31
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,379
I'm not here for the price on your head Uthid, I believe you're innocent.

32
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,200
Innocent, ha! Come on, then.

33
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,900
UTHID: If this is a trick, it's a good one, you've earned your kill.

34
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,829
ALOY: No tricks, just talk.

35
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,550
Alright, speak.

36
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,627
I want to know what happened at Sunfall. What really happened.

37
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,050
For weeks each dawn in the tent city came with a new death.

38
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,370
Always in their sleep, no struggle.

39
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,559
The old, the infirm, sometimes the young.

40
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,550
Those who couldn't fight for the cause.

41
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,240
I should have realised then it was a culling.

42
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,850
Who would do such a thing?

43
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,617
They thought it was a curse, an evil spirit.

44
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,094
But it was only a man and a silent poison.

45
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,372
It took time to catch him, but we did.

46
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,649
We brought him before Bahavas for the Sun's judgement.

47
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,250
He's the one who put the bounty on you.

48
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,799
Yes. He thanked me for my diligence, then had his guards release the villain.

49
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:42,680
You see, it was he who ordered the culling.

50
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,850
Then they turned on us.

51
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,519
Should have died with my men, so their loyalty meant something.

52
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,063
Twenty years I gave to the Sun, for what?

53
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,250
Malice and murder?

54
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,399
As for honour, sacrifice, true sacrifice,
the kind priests and rulers know nothing of?

55
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,769
It's all a fat joke.

56
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,060
If it's honour you seek the Sun Carja seem trustworthy.

57
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,750
A little stuck up, maybe, but trustworthy.

58
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,660
Those Carja once raided your Nora lands, raided every land we could reach.

59
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,819
It was the Sun's will.

60
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,611
I did what I was told, others did worse.

61
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,300
But as their captain, I had–

62
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,959
Uthid, I don't care what you did. I can't absolve you.

63
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,830
But the Carja are changing their ways, you could too.

64
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,370
Perhaps. Avad doesn't understand what the Sun demands of its soldiers.

65
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,149
Perhaps he understands it too well.

66
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,549
Now you sound like the Blameless Marad.

67
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,649
I can believe you're a good man,
but why go with the Shadow Carja in the first place?

68
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:48,967
Why serve them?

69
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,876
Because of Itamen, of course. He was the one true Sun-King.

70
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:55,139
Itamen's just a child.

71
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,850
Yes, an untainted vessel.

72
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,336
I believed he was pure, but they used him, used our faith.

73
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,467
I can see that now, no shadows under a noonday sun.

74
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,068
Bahavas didn't need to disgrace my name, I did it myself serving a rotten throne.

75
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,740
I met someone who wants to get you out of this, a woman named Vanasha.

76
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,149
But first we need to get you out of here.

77
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,090
What are you?

78
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,011
You look like a hunter, you give orders like a soldier who's been—

79
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:28,829
UTHID: Mercenaries.

80
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,659
KIKUK: Should have stayed on the plains, Carja!

81
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,332
KIKUK: The mountains belong to us, Kikuk's Killers.

82
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:40,255
When we're done with you, you won't even leave an echo.

83
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,339
You didn't make it hard to be followed,
almost as if you wanted to go out in a showdown.

84
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,200
Not much gets by you.

85
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
KILLER: On me!

86
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,824
UTHID: The fury of the Sun!

87
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,049
KILLER: Keep at it.

88
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:26,202
KIKUK: Move in! We'll send the rest as soon as they arrive.

89
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,840
KILLER: Grind them down.

90
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:47,635
KIKUK: It's up to you now, men. Rally, we can still finish them!

91
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:14,425
KILLER: You're not gonna see it coming.

92
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,713
KIKUK: Move in! We'll send the rest as soon as they arrive.

93
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,340
KILLER: Eat this!

94
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,179
UTHID: Stand before us, fall beneath us.

95
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,199
UTHID: That won't be the last of them. Follow me, I've stashed supplies up above.

96
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,649
UTHID: Up and over.

97
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,049
ODUND: A robust defence is the most satisfying to break.

98
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,003
ODUND: All right, Marvels. We brought the priest out here,
so let's put on a show for him.

99
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,817
UTHID: I know that hood. We have unfinished business, Bahavas and I.

100
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,149
UTHID: This will be difficult. I think you rallied to a lost cause.

101
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,920
ALOY: I don't intend to die today, Uthid.

102
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,100
UTHID: I did. But you're starting to change my mind.

103
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,738
MARVEL: No matter, you'll feel my next arrow

104
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:31,417
UTHID: Look out, to your left!
ODUND: Not bad, but my Marvels thrive on adversity. Step it up, boys!

105
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,159
MARVEL: We're getting picked off!

106
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:44,895
MARVEL: —regroup!

107
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,467
MARVEL: Got all I need to finish you off!

108
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,350
UTHID: We'll down them swiftly.

109
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,330
ALOY: That's the last of the Marvels.

110
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,262
UTHID: Bahavas thought he had enough fodder to keep him safe.

111
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,849
UTHID: Now there's hope for justice. Will you come with me?

112
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,000
UTHID: This won't be easy, Bahavas still has his personal guard.

113
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,690
ALOY: Snow chill, itches.

114
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,759
UTHID: Across there and we'll have him.

115
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:15,509
BAHAVAS: I had to come here myself to end your suffering, Uthid. And mine.

116
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:22,660
BAHAVAS: The outlanders led us here,
and now that they are dead their price is most affordable.

117
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,319
BAHAVAS: But enough with needles. It's time for blades.

118
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,549
BAHAVAS: Remove them from the Sun's sight!

119
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,119
SHADOW CARJA: Sun's judgement upon you!

120
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,088
BAHAVAS: Make it hurt as the Shadow falls upon them!

121
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,615
SHADOW CARJA: Focus on that one!

122
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:15,997
BAHAVAS: The Sun sets on your pathetic life, Uthid!

123
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:32,543
BAHAVAS: Kill the traitor! Kill the Nora!

124
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,160
BAHAVAS: Make it hurt as the Shadow falls upon them!

125
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:07,200
ALOY: Okay, That helps.

126
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,984
BAHAVAS: The Sun sets on your pathetic life, Uthid!
UTHID: Press the attack!

127
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:30,000
BAHAVAS: Kill the traitor! Kill the Nora!
UTHID: Up to his perch!

128
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,819
BAHAVAS: Whatever deal you worked out with him,
I'll double it! More than double it!

129
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,467
UTHID: No. I'm tired of this, Bahavas.

130
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,955
UTHID: The lies and the violence and your cheap scented oils.

131
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:06,669
UTHID: I don't suppose you'd kill yourself?

132
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,086
BAHAVAS: I had to! I had to!

133
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:12,841
BAHAVAS: Prune the weak, or all the Carja in Shadow are doomed!

134
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:18,392
UTHID: This solves nothing,
but may the Sun find some worth among your drying bones.

135
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,029
VANASHA: That was quite a fireworks show!

136
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,160
ALOY: You took your time.

137
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,766
VANASHA: I was busy.

138
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:47,500
What do you think happened to Yun's Shunned, the other mercenary band?

139
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,410
VANASHA: And I had to organise passage to Meridian for a wanted man.

140
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,460
VANASHA: Give us a moment, Uthid. Girl talk.

141
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,390
You've had quite a day.

142
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,288
I never imagined Bahavas would blunder into his own trap.

143
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,269
What's going to happen at Sunfall now that Bahavas is dead?

144
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,348
Oh, it will be glorious!

145
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,949
The priests will panic.

146
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,548
There'll be infighting, skullduggery, and backstabbing, as they wrangle for power.

147
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:18,551
Best of all, they'll be distracted.

148
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:25,200
Bahavas, your life brought misery
but your death is a flower that blooms in abundance.

149
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Death suits him better than those robes ever did.

150
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,838
Remember Itamen and Nasadi,
the child-king and his mother, guarded like hostages at Sunfall?

151
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,199
With Bahavas gone, no-one will be watching them.

152
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,098
I want to get them out, and I could use your help.

153
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,838
Kidnapping the Sun-King of the Shadow Carja is no small task.

154
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,339
It's not kidnapping. They want to go to Meridian, to safety.

155
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,838
How do you know that?

156
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,369
I've been posing as the Nasadi's handmaiden.

157
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,180
She's scared. For herself, of course, but mostly for Itamen.

158
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,490
Why do you care what happens to them?

159
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,439
Itamen is the Shadow Carja's figurehead.

160
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,569
If he defects, it will remove their last trace of legitimacy.

161
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,009
Beyond that, he's just a boy who clings to his mommy.

162
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,349
What's going to happen to Uthid now?

163
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,319
Don't worry, you gave him a second life and I'll put it to good use.

164
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,049
He'll be welcomed in Meridian as a military adviser.

165
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,538
Hopefully, he can help Avad finish the Shadow Carja
with as little bloodshed as possible.

166
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:33,209
What do you need to get Nasadi and Itamen out of Sunfall?

167
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,680
Sunfall is the easy part, I'll handle that.

168
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,279
The big fuss will be crossing the border to the Sundom.

169
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,210
Find my friend Three-Toed Huavid near the Branded Shore.

170
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:51,034
I hired his crew to sweep the path, so all you have to do is wait for me.

171
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,476
If this Huadiv has already cleared the area why do you need me?

172
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:58,558
Contingencies, little huntress.

173
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,337
Something will go wrong and I need protection I can count on. You.

174
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,859
I'll try not to disappoint.

175
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,960
UTHID: Are we bound for Meridian?

176
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,279
VANASHA: Only if you want to go, my dear.

177
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,099
UTHID: What choice do I have?

178
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,029
VANASHA: None at all, I was just being polite.

179
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,869
UTHID: What makes you think Avad will welcome me after I served his enemies?

180
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,479
VANASHA: He's a forgiving man.

181
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,483
VANASHA: Just smile a lot. You can smile, can't you?

182
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,349
VANASHA: No, that's … that's a grimace.

183
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,809
VANASHA: Nervous about going to Meridian?

184
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,309
UTHID: I've been a soldier for 20 years. I do not get nervous.

185
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,229
VANASHA: Not even around a pretty lady?

186
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,039
UTHID: I will not dignify that with a response.

187
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,076
Easy, easy!

188
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:05,630
You're down, the others haven't noticed.

189
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,880
Never know when I might need these.

190
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,315
Uh-oh, someone's grumpy.

191
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:33,564
There we go, information to help me override more machines.

192
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,637
So, Hephaestus is the source of the Cauldron data intrusions?

193
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:57,590
It's been forcing Cauldrons to make aggressive machines.

194
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,360
Deadlier and deadlier, year by year.

195
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:04,986
Why? And what, or who, is Hephaestus?

196
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,385
Another mystery to add to the list.

197
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,803
Just stay out of their way for now.

198
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,236
That hurt it!

199
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,777
That's it, I'm already gone.

200
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:24,266
Hunt's over, fight's on.

201
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,829
They're scanning for me.

202
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,685
Uh, too slow!

203
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,400
Stocking up.

204
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,639
Keep quiet now.

205
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:09,570
Passed the test.

206
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,585
You're Three-Toed Huavid, right? Vanasha sent me. What happened?
