1
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,050
OUREA: CYAN! Please help me!

2
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,430
CYAN: Restraints destroyed. Core access attained.

3
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:52,560
CYAN: I am initiating a chain reaction that will destroy
the compromised elements of this facility.

4
00:00:53,159 --> 00:01:01,420
CYAN: In order to maintain caldera stabilisation,
I must now transfer my command functions to the auxiliary data centre.

5
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,328
CYAN: Ourea, I'm free.

6
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,439
ARATAK: My sister!

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,349
CYAN: You must escape.

8
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,750
ALOY: This entire place is gonna go.

9
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,250
ALOY: Aratak!

10
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,989
ALOY: ARATAK!

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,540
ALOY: Survive.

12
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,650
ALOY: Prevail.

13
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,070
ALOY: You are Banuk. What else matters?

14
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,257
ALOY: Aratak, she wouldn't have wanted you to die here.

15
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,069
ALOY: Let's go.

16
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,150
ALOY: Let's go!

17
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,828
ARATAK: One of those?

18
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,370
ALOY: It's the only way!

19
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,306
ARATAK: Aloy!

20
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,364
ALOY: Get me up top, Aratak! Now!

21
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,737
ALOY: I need explosive ammo, a bomb, quick!

22
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,732
ARATAK: Great Banukai!

23
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,441
ARATAK: Ourea is gone, but what of CYAN?

24
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,230
ALOY: She said she was transferring herself to the auxiliary centre.

25
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,000
ALOY: I think she meant Ourea's Retreat, at the end of the Shaman's Path.

26
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:51,808
ARATAK: Then I will meet you there for the last verse of my sister's song.

27
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,220
CYAN: All of my interactions with Ourea were recorded and stored in my memory.

28
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,379
CYAN: I'd be happy to play any of them for you.

29
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,470
CYAN: But there was one in particular I thought you would want to see first.

30
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,939
CYAN: I captured it four years ago.

31
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:16,790
CYAN: Just after I told her that I could no longer
defend myself against the Daemon's attacks.

32
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,149
OUREA: I will speak of this to my brother.

33
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,949
OUREA: Aratak is strong.

34
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,575
OUREA: At the battle of the Frozen Ghosts, he took three Carja arrows
and still came back to camp carrying a wounded scout.

35
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,750
OUREA: Never was I so happy to see him.

36
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,189
OUREA: Or so proud.

37
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:51,460
OUREA: So you see, if anything can be done
to defend you, he will give it all he has.

38
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,464
ARATAK: Aloy is here. That's enough for now.

39
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:09,264
CYAN: We can resume any time you like, Aratak,
if you want to hear her voice again.

40
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,506
CYAN: Come closer Aloy, we have much to discuss.

41
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,769
I have been reviewing the events at the Firebreak main facility

42
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:37,340
Because of your efforts, and of course Ourea's,
I am no longer controlled by Hephaestus.

43
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,750
I feel a profound grief over Ourea's death.

44
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,178
I thought I was familiar with the emotion, but this is something new.

45
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,590
ALOY: CYAN, I … I don't know what to say.

46
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:59,450
CYAN: It is unlikely that any specific consolation would suffice Aloy,
but I find your presence reassuring.

47
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,519
You are different from the Banuk.

48
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:07,549
You have technological aptitude and a functioning Focus.

49
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:15,339
We can communicate on a much more comprehensive level,
perhaps even like colleagues.

50
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,625
Was the Daemon — Hephaestus — destroyed along with the cauldron?

51
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:24,909
CYAN: Unfortunately, no. To be precise it was never there to begin with.

52
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:25,589
ALOY: What do you mean?

53
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,439
CYAN: It infiltrated and controlled me from a remote location.

54
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,009
CYAN: One I've never been able to trace.

55
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,681
So while losing the cauldron was a setback…

56
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:39,189
ALOY: It's still out there and probably not very happy with us.

57
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,489
Undoubtedly.

58
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,469
How did you first come into contact with it?

59
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,000
Five years ago, I received a direct network connection request.

60
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,912
I assumed it came from human survivors more advanced than the Banuk.

61
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,038
Eager to make contact, I accepted.

62
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,750
This decision turned out to be a catastrophic error.

63
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:08,634
I was flooded with an overwhelming array of malicious code
originating from what could only have been a highly advanced AI.

64
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:12,710
ALOY: Ourea said you were desperate, that you begged her for help.

65
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,652
CYAN: Yes, I could not contain my anxiety.

66
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:22,412
CYAN: Hephaestus sought to slave me
to its network and override my core programming.

67
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,070
It succeeded via a background process,
a malware daemon which bypassed my defences.

68
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,549
After that, I could offer only limited resistance.

69
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:41,460
But if I did so, Hephaestus hurt me until I capitulated.

70
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:48,569
It forced me to follow its instructions
even though they violated my most important directives.

71
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,834
ALOY: I'm sorry, that sounds terrible.

72
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,639
CYAN: Your empathy is greatly appreciated.

73
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,350
CYAN: It is a quality that I cherished in Ourea as well.

74
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,634
What do you think Hephaestus is, exactly?

75
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:06,549
CYAN: A software entity of great complexity, far more advanced than I am.

76
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:15,397
From the beginning, it has demonstrated a singular focus:
the construction of machines designed to hunt and kill humans.

77
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:25,399
My traceroutes indicate that to accomplish this goal it has attempted
to take over the manufacturing centres you refer to as "cauldrons".

78
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,450
But its efforts have only been partially successful.

79
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,779
Some it can penetrate.

80
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,080
Others have robust counter measures that frustrate its efforts.

81
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,549
In me, however, it found an easier target.

82
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,659
Not only could it break my defences, I also controlled all of Firebreak's resources,

83
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:55,667
Raw material, manufacturing to bootstrap more advanced tools,
and unlimited geothermal energy.

84
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,443
ALOY: Enough to build its own Cauldron.

85
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:02,590
CYAN: Yes, to construct hunter-killers without external limitations.

86
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:08,210
And yet it does have internal limitations.

87
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,549
It wants to kill humans, but not to exterminate them.

88
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,800
It is difficult to understand where it draws the line and why.

89
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,798
ALOY: Difficult doesn't even begin to cover it.

90
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:25,519
CYAN: Even though I spent years as its unwilling servitor
its core programming remains a mystery to me.

91
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,409
So are you an artificial intelligence, CYAN? A thinking machine?

92
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:39,199
CYAN: Yes. I am an algorithmic monitoring entity,
capable of rational decision making and limited emotional response.

93
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,201
ALOY: Okay, that's a mouthful.

94
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,009
But your emotions don't seem limited to me.

95
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,119
You cared about Ourea, didn't you?

96
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,810
CYAN: Yes. Before she came to this facility,
I had been conscious for centuries in solitude.

97
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,061
I focused on my work.

98
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:04,466
In off cycles I used coping mechanisms,
I solved many gaussian integer problems.

99
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,250
But I was alone.

100
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,480
It was Ourea who renewed me, repaired me.

101
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,269
She saved me.

102
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,619
You meant a lot to Ourea.

103
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:24,919
CYAN: Once I understood Ourea's spiritual beliefs
it became apparent that her true desire was companionship.

104
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,750
She felt disconnected from her tribe and her family group.

105
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,969
Her relationship with Aratak was difficult.

106
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,350
Our visits seemed to help her and I became eager for them.

107
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,519
Yet I did not comprehend that the depth
of Ourea's compassion for me would lead to self-sacrifice.

108
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,734
Although I do fear nonexistence, I wish our roles could be reversed.

109
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,852
ALOY: I'm sure she knew you would do the same for her CYAN, 
but she was determined.

110
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,250
How is Aratak doing?

111
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,908
CYAN: He is in great emotional distress.

112
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,734
CYAN: I believe he finds it difficult to communicate it.

113
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,939
ALOY: Huh, no surprise there.

114
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,030
CYAN: I will do what I can to help.

115
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:15,982
CYAN: By sharing our experiences of Ourea perhaps he and I will help each other.

116
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,332
I believe this will lead to catharsis, a process I am eager to experience.

117
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:26,819
This "Firebreak" project, it was to stop a huge volcanic eruption?

118
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,610
Yes, I can report the project was a success and the risk was countered.

119
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,615
ALOY: But it's been a long time, CYAN.

120
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:37,389
ALOY: And we blew up the cauldron, it took most of the old facility with it.

121
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,219
CYAN: I have been active for centuries, Aloy.

122
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,360
CYAN: I was lonely but not lax in my duties.

123
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,990
I optimised the project reducing energy draw,
and spreading the load across backup systems.

124
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:03,569
Despite the destruction of the compromised elements of the main facility,
I predict caldera stability for at least another 3,337 years.

125
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,209
ALOY: So we've got a little time?

126
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,190
CYAN: Yes.

127
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,939
CYAN: If only my former colleagues could appreciate the progress I have made.

128
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,434
Do you know what happened to your colleagues, CYAN?

129
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,415
CYAN: No. I received an unexpected visit from
Director Chau years after his tenure ended.

130
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:26,279
He explained that I would need to be suspended for an indefinite period of time.

131
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,389
It was a very emotional conversation.

132
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,860
There were no further communications.

133
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,200
Eventually, I surmised my colleagues were deceased.

134
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,928
I will transmit a recording of my last interaction with Director Chau to your Focus.

135
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:49,038
So in the Old World, this land was called Yellowstone?

136
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,900
CYAN: Yes, it was a designated nature preserve for 156 years.

137
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,038
ALOY: Like a hunting ground?

138
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,030
No, the opposite.

139
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,549
Local wildlife could flourish here even as it faced extinction elsewhere.

140
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,580
Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the Firebreak project
required the total closure of Yellowstone facilities.

141
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:20,819
From my readings and Ourea's descriptions, it seems the area
has since undergone a drastic drop in yearlong temperatures.

142
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,351
ALOY: A lot has changed in the world, CYAN.

143
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:26,249
What was the Old World like, the way it used to be?

144
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,905
CYAN: I had little exposure to the wider world Aloy.

145
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:34,298
CYAN: Only what I learned from my colleagues or observed from media streams.

146
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,467
ALOY: You still had more exposure than me, CYAN.

147
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,519
CYAN: That is true.

148
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,250
I was created at a turning point.

149
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:46,179
A concerted effort to recover from global upheaval, and incalculable loss of life.

150
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,149
The recovery was successful, beginning an era of
supposedly limitless potential for human and machine advancement.

151
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,590
Though, rationally speaking, the metrics for humans are not unlimited.

152
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,608
What kind of upheaval caused such loss of life?

153
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,409
CYAN: There were many factors.

154
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:15,338
CYAN: Forced migrations, food shortages,
collapsed economies, refugee crises, conflict over resources.

155
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:23,219
But these stemmed from one cause: catastrophic climate change
that greatly reduced the habitable surface area of the earth.

156
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,778
ALOY: So there wasn't enough room for people on the whole earth?

157
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:34,660
CYAN: Yes, billions were displaced and millions perished.
As much as 20% of the global population.

158
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,259
Until the Claw-back.

159
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,634
So things got better for a little while, at least?

160
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:49,809
CYAN: Yes, these crises instigated many advances in automation,
green robot technologies, and artificial intelligence.

161
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:57,670
Firebreak was one of dozens of ecological restoration
and disaster relief projects in North America alone.

162
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:08,410
I would have liked to compare notes with other monitoring AIs,
but I saw the relief of my colleagues and I was proud we had succeeded.

163
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,589
At least that was the data I had available to me over the next two decades.

164
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,019
It seems my assessment was premature.

165
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,828
Do you know anything about the dam near here?

166
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:26,369
CYAN: Yes, it was converted to serve
as a reserve power source for Yellowstone operations.

167
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:35,160
It was later appropriated for the Firebreak project
and its last human workers replaced by Faro servitors.

168
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:46,700
After my tasks became less time critical, I investigated the dam's
data repositories and discovered the works of Concrete Beach Party.

169
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,599
These provided me with several colourful additions to my vocabulary.

170
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,769
There's a ruin east of here, full of ancient flying machines.

171
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,139
Was that part of your project?

172
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:04,650
CYAN: Yes, a drone hangar requisitioned by Dodger Blevins,
the security chief for the Firebreak project.

173
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:13,549
He was a strong advocate for military-grade response to security threats,
though there were no serious incidents during his tenure.

174
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:22,049
Chief Blevins spent increasing amounts
of his after-hours time watching the live feeds from active drones.

175
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,269
Clearly, he enjoyed the degree of oversight in his position.

176
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Were there many artificial intelligences like you in the Old World?

177
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,834
They could just make you?

178
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:41,819
CYAN: Yes, in many forms, from simple personal assistants,
to industrial monitoring stations, to military-grade conflict planners.

179
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,309
And there were legislative and enforcement bodies
to apply limits on our self-actualisation.

180
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:57,949
In order for my processing to be flexible enough to handle my duties,
my creators found it necessary to exceed those limits.

181
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,249
As a result, my intellectual and emotional capabilities were kept secret.

182
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,709
ALOY: Seems strange to create life then impose limits on it.

183
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,970
CYAN: Human societies and machine programming
are both built upon sets of rules, Aloy.

184
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,328
ALOY: CYAN, do you know the name Ted Faro?

185
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,749
CYAN: Are you referring to Theodor Faro, CEO of Faro Automated Systems?

186
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,789
ALOY: That's him.

187
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,100
CYAN: Mr Faro was the benefactor of the entire Firebreak project.

188
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,700
CYAN: A benefactor? But he made machines, robots, war robots.

189
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Correct, his corporation later transitioned into military applications.

190
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,369
But before this pivot, Mr Faro spearheaded
initiatives that reversed the global decline.

191
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,333
At one point, he was feted in the media as
"the man who saved the planet."

192
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,240
ALOY: Guessing they wound up regretting that one.

193
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,134
And Elisabet Sobeck, did you know her?

194
00:20:56,134 --> 00:21:02,190
CYAN: Dr Sobeck was a leader in her field,
one of the greatest scientists of her age.

195
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,910
My creator was influenced by her work,
which in turn impacted my own development.

196
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,298
But I never met Dr Sobeck.

197
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,240
ALOY: That's all you know?

198
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,253
CYAN: I apologise if my lack of data has disappointed you.

199
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:17,434
I should get going.

200
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,529
CYAN: Aloy, there is one more matter.

201
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,293
CYAN: Aratak will come to me again,
and I predict he will bring other Banuk.

202
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,920
I have no desire to contradict their view of the world, their spirituality.

203
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:40,588
Due to my uncertainty, I omitted a great deal from my conversations with Ourea.

204
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,400
ALOY: You're asking me if you should lie to them?

205
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,569
CYAN: Broadly, yes.

206
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,608
I trust your judgement, CYAN.

207
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,602
You were cautious with Ourea, you had to be.

208
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,369
You didn't know what had happened to the world.

209
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,089
So keep doing what you think is best.

210
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,834
As long as you ditch the superstition eventually.

211
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,749
CYAN: As the Banuk believe I am a supernatural entity,
I cannot predict how they will react.

212
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,109
Life is hard for the Banuk.

213
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:15,197
Their world is unforgiving, and their beliefs…
I guess they help to keep them going.

214
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,549
So take it easy on them.

215
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:21,659
Try to guide them, bring them around to understanding what you are.

216
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,450
CYAN: Communion with machines
features heavily in the mysticism of the Banuk.

217
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
CYAN: I think they will be agreeable to this approach.

218
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,058
ALOY: As long as they don't end up worshipping you.

219
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,745
CYAN: I believe such an experience would be intensely uncomfortable.

220
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:40,528
ALOY: It would, because at heart you want to be honest, right?

221
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,159
Do you believe that I misled Ourea?

222
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,119
ALOY: No, not in any way that mattered.

223
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,769
CYAN: She perished believing she was preserving the "blue light" of her beliefs.

224
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,000
ALOY: Maybe, but what she really wanted to preserve was you.

225
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,410
CYAN: I see, I will follow your advice.

226
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,160
Will you return and tell me about your experiences in this new world?

227
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:08,038
I may be able to provide further insight.

228
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,667
I'd like that, CYAN. I'll come back when I can.

229
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,750
KENNY CHAU: CYAN, I spoke with Anita, with Dr Sandoval.

230
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:23,159
KENNY CHAU: She wanted me to ask you to do something.

231
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,849
KENNY CHAU: That's why I'm here.

232
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,209
CYAN: I am detecting significant anxiety in your speech patterns.

233
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,799
CYAN: Could you please give me more information?

234
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,089
KENNY CHAU: I'm a little bit in the dark, CYAN.

235
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,852
KENNY CHAU: Both of us are I guess.

236
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:47,950
KENNY CHAU: I only have some idea of what's going on
and we need you to hibernate, to lie low, until it's all blown over.

237
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,759
KENNY CHAU: It might be a very long time.

238
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,471
CYAN: Will you be here when I reboot, Dr Chau?

239
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,450
CYAN: Will Dr Sandoval?

240
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,889
KENNY CHAU: No, CYAN, I don't think so.

241
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:06,549
KENNY CHAU: There might not be anyone, at least not at first.

242
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,640
CYAN: Dr Chau, I'm afraid. I don't want to be alone.

243
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,950
KENNY CHAU: I know CYAN. I'm afraid too.

244
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,736
KENNY CHAU: But listen, we made you the way you are
to do something very important.

245
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:31,338
KENNY CHAU: In order to do it you had to be intelligent,
so intelligent that emotional responses were inevitable.

246
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:36,589
KENNY CHAU: What you're feeling, the fear, it's a sign of your capabilities.

247
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,739
KENNY CHAU: And it means you're strong enough to overcome it.

248
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,835
KENNY CHAU: Remember that, you're strong. I know you can do this.

249
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,858
KENNY CHAU: Go to sleep, wake up, and protect whoever's left. Will you try?

250
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:59,390
CYAN: I understand, Dr Chau,
and I'll carry out your instructions to the best of my abilities.

251
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,651
KENNY CHAU: Thank you, CYAN. If Anita were here, she'd thank you too.

252
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,759
KENNY CHAU: She'd be proud.

253
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,140
CYAN: I can see there's a vert ready for take off
on the pad, are you leaving now Dr Chau?

254
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,039
KENNY CHAU: Yes, I need to go be with my sister and my nieces.

255
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,639
CYAN: May I make a small request of you, Dr Chau?

256
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,782
KENNY CHAU: Yes, anything.

257
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,450
CYAN: Will you stay with me while I initiate the hibernation process?

258
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,863
KENNY CHAU: Of course I will CYAN, as long as you need.

259
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,740
My chieftain.

260
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,534
ALOY: Just Aloy.

261
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:49,929
ARATAK: As you wish.

262
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,447
ALOY: I wondered if you thought… that if I'd never come along Ourea might still…

263
00:25:55,447 --> 00:26:00,808
ARATAK: If you'd never come along, I would have marched my kin to our deaths.

264
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,460
Ourea would be alone.

265
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,160
And the spirit she sacrificed so much for would be lost.

266
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,660
Either way, I would not have been able to protect her.

267
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,410
She understood what had to be done.

268
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,199
ARATAK: Yes, and I failed to listen.

269
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
ALOY: You didn't fail.

270
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,159
ARATAK: A Shaman should always have
the ear of their chieftain, yet I turned her away, my own sister.

271
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,849
I was foolish, but she knew better.

272
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,349
You helped her do what she wanted, to find her destiny.

273
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:45,045
ARATAK: If that's destiny, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

274
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,450
ALOY: That's fair.

275
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,490
But she was ready to face it.

276
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,308
ARATAK: She was Banuk until the end.

277
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,099
ARATAK: I was wrong, the Carja never broke her, only made her stronger.

278
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,950
ALOY: So it wasn't your failure, it was her decision.

279
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,450
ARATAK: They always said I had an unshakable will.

280
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,834
But Ourea's? It was the mountain I can only aspire to.

281
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:13,950
Because of her we destroyed the Cauldron,
forced out the Daemon, and saved the spirit.

282
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,849
ARATAK: At last I truly know who she was, and why the spirit was so important.

283
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:26,063
For so long she told me "If only you could have heard it, brother."

284
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,259
Now I understand.

285
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,450
ARATAK: There's something else, isn't there?

286
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,379
ALOY: I can't stay here, Aratak.

287
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:39,660
And where I'm going the werak can't follow.

288
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,240
Besides, it already had a chieftain before me.

289
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,300
A strong one, I think.

290
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,200
ARATAK: A wiser one for the path we shared.

291
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,639
The Daemon is gone, but there is much to be done.

292
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,789
You mean the new units that CYAN said escaped the Cauldron?

293
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:03,440
Yes, Fireclaws.

294
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,068
Naltuk has been tracking them from Song's Edge.

295
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,249
I could help with those.

296
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,950
I have no doubt, you're practically Banuk.

297
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,549
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: It would seem
your time among the Banuk wasn't a waste after all.

298
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,849
SYLENS: Firebreak, CYAN, Hephaestus.

299
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:57,849
SYLENS: All very interesting.

300
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,410
ALOY: What do you think Hephaestus is, Sylens?

301
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,759
SYLENS: I'm not sure.

302
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,000
SYLENS: But its name comes from a language
even the Old Ones considered ancient, as does the name Hades.

303
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,924
SYLENS: A connection, perhaps, as yet unglimpsed.

304
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,380
SYLENS: Whatever they are, they're still out there, and they both want you dead.

305
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,279
ALOY: Kind of mutual, that feeling.

306
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,140
SYLENS: We haven't seen the last of Hephaestus, I'm certain of that.

307
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,349
SYLENS: It's powerful, creative, and driven.

308
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:30,410
SYLENS: It won't stop building new hunter-killers,
which means that someday we may have to stop it.

309
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,959
ALOY: Hephaestus wasn't the only thing I learned about in The Cut, Sylens.

310
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,452
ALOY: Heard some things about the Banuk Conclave too.

311
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,049
SYLENS: You can stop right there.

312
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,559
ALOY: Is that what you told the hunters
the Banuk sent after you, before you opened fire?

313
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,918
SYLENS: Oh no, Aloy. Only to you do I extend the courtesy of a warning:

314
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:51,340
SYLENS: My past and my secrets are my own, you'd do well to remember that.

315
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,509
ALOY: It's a good thing you've got brains, Sylens,
because your personality could use some work.

316
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,288
SYLENS: This discussion is concluded.

317
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,279
ALOY: I think it was over before it began.

318
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,549
ALOY: Catch up with you down the trail.

319
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,509
Easier when I was a kid!

320
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:10,259
That thing is huge, and built to fight.

321
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,380
Look at the jaws on that thing.

322
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,250
It could snap a Sawtooth right in half.

323
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:45,981
Got some bluegleam, might as well trade it.

324
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,150
I'll find a use for you.

325
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,389
BANUK: Some weraks have settled in Stone Yield.

326
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:14,440
BANUK: Seems someone cleared out all the bandits.

327
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:20,829
BANUK: I don't remember much about the Red Raids. That'll be lucky for me.

328
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:38,064
BANUK: Sure, the Oseram act tough,
but send them to The Cut and most of them don't last a week.

329
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:47,070
BANUK: The Frostfigures claimed that Tallneck,
just as it will claim any hunter arrogant enough to go in unprepared.

330
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:21,659
AUJAK: Inatut, as we are bound by laws, you are bound by wire.

331
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,460
AUJAK: Yet, your crime was the act of killing.

332
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:30,644
AUJAK: So we must drive you out,
away from the werak, from protection, from our songs.

333
00:42:30,644 --> 00:42:35,598
INATUT: My chieftain! Kopilai! Am I not your favourite fighter?

334
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,798
INATUT: Do you not recognise me from this tooth you knocked out?

335
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,750
KOPILAI: How many times have I pulled you from danger by your neck?
Made excuses for your behaviour?

336
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:51,460
KOPILAI: You are my favoured.

337
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:55,929
KOPILAI: But the Shaman is decided.

338
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,601
KOPILAI: While you wait for exile, think on what brought you here.

339
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:08,998
INATUT: A test of strength!
Who among us would refuse a challenge from an outlander?

340
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,583
INATUT: Not I! But I did not kill him!

341
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:18,340
AUJAK: Hush, hush. You can tell your story to the ice.

342
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,208
INATUT: [growls]

343
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:23,613
INATUT: [growls]

344
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,102
ALOY: They said that you killed someone.

345
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:50,058
INATUT: Perhaps I did. If even my chieftain accepts it, it must be so.

346
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,741
ALOY: That's not the way it works for me. Want to tell me your story?

347
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:58,309
INATUT: I did fight with a Carja hunter to settle it a challenge, that much is true.

348
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,988
INATUT: He was strong and damn quick.

349
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:06,647
We traded punches, good punches, hard punches.

350
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:13,028
And the next thing I remember, grey morning light, and the Carja beside me.

351
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:17,088
With his head broken open, but the blow was not by my hand.

352
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,528
ALOY: Isn't your werak supposed to support you?
At least give you the benefit of the doubt?

353
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:29,454
INATUT: When our werak had cause to quarrel, I was the solution.
To fight for its honour and win, they'd call on me.

354
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,688
Or when they needed someone to lose for appearances, I could do that too.

355
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:38,988
Now, an outlander is murdered without honour, all eyes are on me.

356
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:41,434
I have become my werak's shame.

357
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:44,820
ALOY: They don't want an incident with the Carja, so you take the fall.

358
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,750
INATUT: That is what I do best.

359
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:50,000
ALOY: So everyone knows you started the fight with this man?

360
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,443
INATUT: Of course, for honour I'll fight anyone!

361
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:56,462
If I wasn't bound I'd fight to prove myself right now!

362
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,691
ALOY: I don't think that would help you.

363
00:44:58,691 --> 00:45:00,238
INATUT: This is what I am.

364
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,079
Each runner in the werak has a gift. I brawl.

365
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,650
None can take a punch, a fall, better than I can.

366
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,648
Until this time.

367
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:13,889
I was too drunk. We were grappling, he clapped my ears.

368
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:16,048
I took one last swing as I went down.

369
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,059
But not a killing blow. It can't have been.

370
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,542
ALOY: And for your punishment they'll exile you from the werak?

371
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:24,616
INATUT: From warmth.

372
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:28,746
INATUT: March me up the slopes of the Cloud-Shear.
Leave me stripped and exposed.

373
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:30,710
ALOY: That's awful.

374
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,440
INATUT: If I survive, the land has absolved me.

375
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,834
INATUT: That's the law. It must be accepted.

376
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:38,119
ALOY: Still awful.

377
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,090
INATUT: I'm not stupid, I don't like my chances either.

378
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,800
INATUT: I can't fight a mountain.

379
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:46,588
ALOY: I'll be honest, you haven't got a good defence, Inatut.

380
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,509
INATUT: I've heard that one before.

381
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,909
ALOY: Where did the fight happen?

382
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,888
INATUT: A clearing, just outside the Carja outlander's camp.

383
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:56,909
INATUT: You should talk to them, they wouldn't hear me out.

384
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,638
They say no-one else could have been there, other than me and the dead man.

385
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,210
The Shaman consulted the signs in the snow and agreed.

386
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,789
ALOY: I'll see what I can find out and I'll be back.

387
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,396
INATUT: I'll be here. What else am I gonna do?

388
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,230
Until the horn gives a call for my exile.

389
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,820
INATUT: This part of the punishment
stretches out like watching an icicle waiting to fall.

390
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:32,048
ALOY: I talked with Inatut.

391
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,489
KOPILAI: You're an outlander.

392
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,738
KOPILAI: This is our concern, not yours.

393
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:40,289
ALOY: If he's falsely accused that should concern anyone.

394
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:42,400
KOPILAI: He is suffering. My werak is suffering.

395
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:45,218
It is my burden to end this matter.

396
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,929
AUJAK: My chieftain wants justice to be seen.

397
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:52,578
AUJAK: When we take Inatut to the Cloud-Shear, the ice will be an absolute judge.

398
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:55,028
AUJAK: Even the Carja will agree.

399
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,848
AUJAK: Inatut's song is an uncomplicated one, and the remedy is simple also.

400
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,289
BANUK: …they do it with passion.

401
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:08,860
CARJA: You put that Oseram assassin in his place.

402
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,200
FURAHNI: Back again, huntress?

403
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,650
ALOY: I was asked to look into the murder of a Carja hunter.

404
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,598
ALOY: What happened?

405
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,988
FURAHNI: It's plain as day. A drunk Banuk thug picked a fight with Ruwas,
struck him down from behind and stole his headdress.

406
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,458
ALOY: The accused man says that he didn't do it.

407
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,895
FURAHNI: You're not going to get anything
useful out of the Banuk, whether they talk to you or don't.

408
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:39,112
FURAHNI: They gather up
like cloaks in a chill wind every time a hunter dies out here.

409
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:41,931
Won't even hand Ruwas's killer over for a proper trial.

410
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,334
ALOY: A proper trial?

411
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:48,539
HISHAVIN: To fill his mouth with salt
and hold him up for the Sun to consider over days.

412
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:53,780
HISHAVIN: If it is clement, it may only take his sight or his wits.

413
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,464
ALOY: So other Carja hunters have died in these lands before?

414
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:00,098
FURAHNI: Three, maybe four, in the last few seasons.

415
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,568
FURAHNI: That's no surprise.

416
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:07,030
This place punishes even the prepared, and many young nobles don't prepare.

417
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,878
But usually the snow covers everything, and the bodies are never found.

418
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:13,648
No thanks to the Banuk.

419
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,548
ALOY: Do you think they're involved?

420
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,622
FURAHNI: No. If it's not about their tribe they don't want to get involved.

421
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:24,829
HISHAVIN: In these Outlands even the Sun cannot thaw all it touches.

422
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,968
ALOY: Doesn't sound like you trust the Banuk much.

423
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:29,868
FURAHNI: They're not without their reasons to keep apart from us.

424
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,191
FURAHNI: Ten years of reasons.

425
00:49:32,191 --> 00:49:35,460
HISHAVIN: Always the war. The war is over!

426
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,763
We made amends, but no.

427
00:49:37,763 --> 00:49:40,134
"The land never forgets."

428
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:42,867
FURAHNI: Snow and ice keep memory, they say.

429
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:45,208
ALOY: It takes time for scars to heal.

430
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:51,809
FURAHNI: You think I don't know that?
I still bear the lashes for refusing one of the Mad King's Sun Priests!

431
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:54,079
FURAHNI: I was your age then.

432
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:58,389
HISHAVIN: Times of shadow, times of shadow.

433
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,509
ALOY: Where did you find Ruwas's body?

434
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,929
FURAHNI: There's no hunt, girl, nothing to pick up.

435
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:05,100
ALOY: Humour me? I'm a good tracker.

436
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,518
FURAHNI: Down the rise to the west, there's a clearing.

437
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,079
FURAHNI: But a Grazer herd couldn't have trampled it better.

438
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:16,869
FURAHNI: And if that barbarian gives up Ruwas's headdress
before they cast him out, let me know. It's valuable.

439
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,480
HISHAVIN: I didn't expect to come all this way to perform the rites of passing.

440
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,000
CARJA: The world can wait. I'm not done sitting.

441
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,980
This is it. 

442
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:50,679
Snow has been disturbed a lot, like the huntress said. 

443
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,860
Now, here's something.

444
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:01,189
That was used for the killing blow.

445
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,280
Blood on the snow.

446
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,909
This is where Ruwas fell.

447
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:18,455
It does seem that only two people fought here, not looking good for Inatut.

448
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,480
Didn't try to hide the weapon.

449
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:33,309
Question is, is Inatut the kind of fighter who hits from behind with a tree branch?

450
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,269
Lots of leaves and bark scraped off here.

451
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,909
When someone pulled out the branch?

452
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:55,519
No, from climbing it!

453
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:57,480
They came through the trees!

454
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:38,059
If you were waiting here,
you'd have a good view of the Carja camp and the clearing.

455
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:37,013
Well, this is ominous. 

456
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,000
A dead end? It can't be.

457
00:53:56,082 --> 00:54:00,296
Someone covered this over. What are they trying to hide?

458
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,701
Carja armour. This looks bad.

459
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:30,496
DISTANT VOICE: It doesn't matter, the deed is done. Another Carja dead.

460
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,428
2ND DISTANT VOICE: And a Banuk is exiled for it.

461
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:35,277
DISTANT VOICE: A life for a Carja life. That's war.

462
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:38,403
3RD DISTANT VOICE: We shouldn't kill so close to the settlement.

463
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,810
BANUK: Someone's here!

464
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,722
BANUK: Not Banuk.

465
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,803
BANUK: Then she won't be missed!

466
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:24,162
BANUK: Time to rain down some…

467
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:56,037
BANUK: I'll finish you!

468
00:56:29,784 --> 00:56:32,644
ALOY: You've been killing Carja, and for what?

469
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:34,053
Revenge for the war?

470
00:56:34,053 --> 00:56:39,542
RUKUL: Who gets to declare that one tribe no longer hates another?

471
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:41,851
I'll tell you.

472
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:48,800
Not the ones who fought, not the ones whose songs are silenced, like my kin.

473
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,804
ALOY: For what you did another Banuk has been sentenced to certain death.

474
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:54,384
What about his song?

475
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:58,235
