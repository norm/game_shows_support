1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,149
ALOY: So now that Talanah is a Hawk, she could become Sunhawk?

2
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:33,000
LIGAN: Yes, if she defeats Redmaw before Ahsis can, then she will take his place.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,759
What exactly is Redmaw?

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
The meanest of all Thunderjaws, some say the first.

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,289
One swipe of its tail and five hunters go down.

6
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,320
It stomps can send boulders tumbling before it.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,899
More than a few have been crushed under their weight.

8
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,809
And thus many have died trying to defeat it.

9
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,929
If Redmaw is so deadly, why do hunters keep going after it?

10
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,719
Anyone who defeats this beast will surely be considered a champion.

11
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,310
Who was Tarkas?

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,069
A respected hunter.

13
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,049
He sponsored Talanah many years ago.

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:13,159
If Talanah was his Thrush, why did he fight Redmaw without her?

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,958
I went to watch the battle.

16
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,858
She should have received word he'd picked up its trail.

17
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,780
Someone at the Lodge failed to pass it on.

18
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,349
Such skill from an outlander on your first attempt.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,050
Take this Blazing Sun as your proof.

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,650
With so many Suns you may wish to speak to Aidaba in Meridian.

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,834
She will have special gear for you.

22
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,449
Right on target.

23
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,329
And up!

24
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,850
And go!

25
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,570
CARJA: Don't let your guard down…

26
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,830
CARJA: The Oseram guard will be blaming their shadows for their mistakes.

27
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,212
CARJA: Did she really save the Sun-King? A Nora?

28
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:10,533
CARJA: That crazy Oseram tried to kill our Sun-King,
but the machine rider stopped him cold.

29
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,444
CARJA: An Oseram tries to kill the Sun-King and a Nora saves his life.
I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

30
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,200
CARJA: I bet those traitorous Oseram will conveniently
lose Dervahl in transport to Mainspring.

31
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:36,467
[Sun Priests singing]

32
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,509
So you've come back to the temple.

33
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,470
I was invited back.

34
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,309
The priests wanted to hear what I had to say
about reconciliation with the other tribes.

35
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,298
They're listening. At least, they've begun to listen.

36
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,274
There's a distance between ears and deeds.

37
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,762
Because of what we did?

38
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:56,467
What you did!

39
00:14:56,467 --> 00:15:00,580
It was for the mourners, I think it helped them.

40
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,149
You set them on the path.

41
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,649
You can't know what their journeys hold.

42
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,200
Such is the priest's lot.

43
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,649
Perhaps a red robe would suit you.

44
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:13,870
[laugh] Not me.

45
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,267
Besides, your temple doesn't even take women.

46
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,299
We would be richer if we did.

47
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:24,240
Go in light, my friend, and let the Sun cast your way.

48
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,899
Thank you, Namman.

49
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,400
Where I'm going, I could probably use all the light I can get.

50
00:15:30,400 --> 00:16:00,165
[Sun Priests singing]

51
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:07,619
VILGUND: Able bodied adventurers, preferably with no friends or family.

52
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:14,459
Outlander, are you looking for… wait, I know your face.

53
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,528
You came back! How did we fare?

54
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:20,109
Expensively.

55
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,450
That's what I was afraid of.

56
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,399
The tame machines…

57
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,809
It's hard to explain, but there was a kind of signal that calmed them.

58
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,539
Your men got greedy so it's gone now.

59
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,928
Gambling's a shoddy job, girl.

60
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,089
I should have been a weapons dealer, that's steady work.

61
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,750
Here, take it.

62
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,740
The half I'd owed those hammer-handed chunks.

63
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,759
Half? I finished the job.

64
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:46,999
And what was it you said?

65
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,350
"Enough to buy a more becoming garb."

66
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,117
What do you want, Carja silks?

67
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:56,470
Agh, hoisted on my own purse strings.

68
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,493
How are the trials going for you?

69
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,450
Have enough marks for a weapon yet?

70
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,500
I believe I have enough here. What next?

71
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:42,048
You brought in all the Sun marks at once!

72
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,489
You're going to make a lot of hunters jealous.

73
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,160
Not that it takes much.

74
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm pleased to present to you a Lodge Blast Sling,
a Lodge Ropecaster, and the Lodge War Bow.

75
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,679
Congratulations! You're a Master Hunter of the Lodge.

76
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,940
All I can give you now is encouragement.

77
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:25,849
Where's Talanah? Maybe upstairs.

78
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,119
No Ahsis either.

79
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,259
Maybe Ligan knows where they are.

80
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,970
You have trophies?

81
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,349
I can hang on to them until the Sunhawk returns.

82
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,395
Where are Ahsis and Talanah?

83
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:46,749
Ahsis received word about Redmaw and rushed out.

84
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,259
Talanah found out a short time later and had to follow.

85
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,759
They both went alone?

86
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,839
Ahsis left without his Thrush, Talanah did as well.

87
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,849
Oh, I saw some outlanders follow after her.

88
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,259
I wouldn't put it past Ahsis to try something underhanded to get the kill.

89
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:07,200
Where have they gone? I have to help if I can.

90
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,940
Mmm, you might be right.

91
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,818
They've gone south-east, headed for the Spearshafts.

92
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,339
You'd better hurry.

93
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,849
MERCHANT: Only the finest goods here.

94
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,849
OSERAM: Here's to Avad, huh?

95
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:44,445
Now they're hunting me.

96
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,900
TALANAH: How much did Ahsis pay you?

97
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,256
ALOY: That sounds like her.

98
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,393
OUTLANDER: The Sun won't save you, get down! 

99
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:34,976
ALOY: These must be the outlanders that followed Talanah. Looks—

100
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
ALOY: —like Ahsis hired some thugs.

101
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,950
OUTLANDER: May you die with–

102
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,849
OUTLANDER: The Sun's message to you!

103
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,049
Thank you.

104
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,730
I should have seen this coming.

105
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,579
Of course he would hire men to keep me from Redmaw.

106
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,599
They died for his pride.

107
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:29,450
Where is Ahsis now?

108
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,129
He's gone after Redmaw.

109
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,740
This way, hurry!

110
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,170
ALOY: Why is Ahsis going after Redmaw alone?

111
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,759
TALANAH: Vanity. He doesn't want to share credit for the kill with his Thrush.

112
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,939
TALANAH My sponsor did the same, went after Redmaw alone out of pride.

113
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,549
TALANAH: Even though he knew we needed to unseat Ahsis.

114
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,598
TALANAH: I'm not sure where Ahsis and Redmaw went from here.

115
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,319
ALOY: I can follow their tracks.

116
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:24,259
ALOY: This way, Redmaw destroyed these trees.

117
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,000
TALANAH: I fear we're too late.

118
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,216
TALANAH: With Tarkas I arrived in time to see him die from his wounds.

119
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:38,873
TALANAH: And with my father I didn't even get that.

120
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,310
ALOY: Where was Ahsis when your father passed?

121
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,170
TALANAH: Watching. He became Sunhawk that day.

122
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:48,599
TALANAH: But won't even speak of the event that made it possible.

123
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,099
TALANAH: That all changes today.

124
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:58,400
TALANAH: There he is!

125
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,100
ALOY: Ahsis is holding his own!

126
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,934
ALOY: Was. Was holding his own.

127
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,009
ALOY: Well, we have our work cut out for us.

128
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:47,903
ALOY: He saw me, this is it.

129
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:19,774
TALANAH: We've taken the wind out of him. He's half done!

130
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:36,467
TALANAH: We're doing it! He's nearly down, just a little bit more.

131
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:05,599
ALOY: Got him!

132
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,850
TALANAH: By the Sun, we did it!

133
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,590
TALANAH: Hello there, beautiful.

134
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,599
TALANAH: We make a great team.

135
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:27,630
ALOY: And now you're the Sunhawk.

136
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,039
TALANAH: About that…

137
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,269
Talanah, he's still alive.

138
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:50,789
Out of the way Nora filth.

139
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,878
You're done. The Lodge is finally free of your influence.

140
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,360
I kept it alive in dark times.

141
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:05,340
No, you buried it along with my father's memory.

142
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,449
AHSIS: I should have … 

143
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:16,500
I should have let you fight Redmaw first to soften him up.

144
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:20,892
Damn.

145
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,500
Here lies the Sunhawk of the Hunters Lodge.

146
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,067
It's almost a shame.

147
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,489
After all that you're gonna weep for him?

148
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,670
Oh, no.

149
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,449
I just wish I could've seen his face when I succeeded him.

150
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,667
Okay, then.

151
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,789
Meet me back at the Hunters Lodge, if you have the time.

152
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:46,039
I have a feeling the new Sunhawk wants to welcome you.

153
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:50,000
My Focus is receiving another signal.

154
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,880
That Tallneck can't be far now.

155
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,196
Okay, I need to get up to the Tallneck's head.

156
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:02,550
Calm, calm.

157
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:37,960
Back to your business.

158
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,567
Couldn't let you call for help.

159
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,860
That hurt it!

160
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,010
This should be a good spot for jumping onto the Tallneck.

161
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,192
Okay, time to climb up to its head.

162
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:07,787
Alright, got what I need.

163
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,599
[whistle]

164
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:30,179
[whistle]

165
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,309
Never know when I might need these.

166
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:11,840
Nil, I did wonder on my way here, well, if you were luring me into an ambush.

167
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,541
Where's the fun in that?

168
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,940
Some bandit sprawl would never have done for our arena.

169
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,621
But this? Much better. There's a sense of drama.

170
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:25,090
So, what do you say?

171
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,880
How about we try to kill each other?

172
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,034
You brought me out here to ask if I want to fight you?

173
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:35,880
To the death. We'll savour it because we only get this one time.

174
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,010
Actually, I don't know what else I expected.

175
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:44,295
You are so conscientious,
I wouldn't want to push you into something that wasn't genuine.

176
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:48,380
Especially death, there is nothing more genuine.

177
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,888
I'm, umm, flattered that you think of me this way.

178
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:55,570
But I don't want to kill you.

179
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:56,949
Don't be hasty.

180
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:02,331
When it's life against death, hunter against hunter, I know it'll come to you.

181
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,460
Is that really what you want, Nil?

182
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,818
You know, I don't think you have a death wish.

183
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,679
What you have might be worse,
but I see there might be a need for you in this world.

184
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,269
I don't understand.

185
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,229
I won't fight you, that's my decision.

186
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:20,909
You can respect it or try to shoot me in the back as I go.

187
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:24,947
Then it's over. Your last arrow is the cruellest.

188
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,185
Umm…

189
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:30,421
It's true, I offered you the choice, but my heart is broken.
