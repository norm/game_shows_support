1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,648
ALOY: So the waters came fast?

2
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:28,031
LAULAI: One day it was dry, the next the nearby river
had risen and the entire basin was flooded.

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,449
I don't understand it.

4
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,459
There was no rain, not even any clouds.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,750
And yet the river rose higher than I'd ever seen it.

6
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:39,297
And there it remains.

7
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,912
A flood without rain, that is strange.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,250
Where is this place?

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,231
I'll have a look if I'm in the area.

10
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:49,079
Just northwest of here.

11
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:52,450
Look all you like, but I don't see what good it will do.

12
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,700
The flood waters aren't going anywhere.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,179
How does one ask a river to relent?

14
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,373
This must be the ruin Laulai was talking about, Deep Din.

15
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,886
Flooded too, like she said.

16
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,310
Snapmaws. 

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,150
Probably came from somewhere up river.

18
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,760
Follow the river, find the source. Seems simple enough.

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,019
These mountains must be the Icerasps.

20
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,925
The Shaman's Path begins somewhere up above.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,126
There, that must be where the water is coming from.

22
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,017
Looks like something from the Old Ones.

23
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,398
Well, somebody wanted in.

24
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:32,470
Nearly blew this entire ledge off just to get through the door.

25
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,234
COMPUTER: Flooding detected, evacuation recommended.

26
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,529
COMPUTER: Overflow basin compromised.

27
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,113
ALOY: The "overflow basin" — is that the Din?

28
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,750
Looks like a control centre.

29
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,920
What happened in here to start the water flowing?

30
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,639
I should be able to shut this place down from here.

31
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,282
Ugh, someone made a mess of this.

32
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:47,312
Hmm, if I had the right parts, I'll bet I could get it working again.

33
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,430
The lock positions, helpful.

34
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,500
A piece is missing.

35
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,110
Not getting in there without it.

36
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,792
Rough waters, no way I'd be able to swim.

37
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,769
Maybe my Focus will see something.

38
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,936
Someone's been through here, not that long ago either.

39
00:07:55,936 --> 00:08:01,096
DISTANT VOICE: Help! I've … er … I've become trapped somehow.

40
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:10,413
DISTANT VOICE: By the forge,
I'm glad to hear another person stomping about in here.

41
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,597
DISTANT VOICE: This blasted door is stuck.

42
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,362
DISTANT VOICE: This is a perfect opportunity to do a good deed.

43
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:23,649
DISTANT VOICE: And clear your conscience
for whatever cruelties you may have committed.

44
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,452
Whoa! Ooof!

45
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,250
ALOY: Are you all right?

46
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,431
[laughs]

47
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:42,428
You don't know how happy you just made me.

48
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:46,149
Haha! For a moment, I thought my fire was snuffed.

49
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,688
My forge gone cold, but no.

50
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:52,197
Nope, not old Gildun.

51
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,055
You're … welcome?

52
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,440
Uh, wait, start from the beginning.

53
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,900
What are you doing down here?

54
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,089
Oh! My apologies.

55
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,049
When you mostly talk to yourself,
you can tell your stories in whatever order you like.

56
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,769
There's an artefact in that storage room I simply must acquire.

57
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,710
But as you may have noticed, the door won't budge.

58
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:24,139
I took one of those roundish ringy whatsits from the wall beside the door.

59
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,250
No luck.

60
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,781
So I had to go with that panel with the button, even less luck!

61
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:37,204
My gentle experimentation caused the chamber to … um … flood. A little.

62
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:40,830
So I pushed the button again, perhaps a little too enthusiastically.

63
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,090
Sparks and smoke!

64
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,480
So you found the button that controls the flow of water.

65
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,918
Quite by accident.

66
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,300
And then you broke that button.

67
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,480
Also quite by accident.

68
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,970
GILDUN: Now, obviously, I came here to investigate.

69
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,251
My cautious footsteps may have contributed, slightly, to the collapse of a bridge.

70
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:08,186
When the bridge began to collapse I may have, for the sake of expedience, abandoned the cumbersome ringy whatsit to the waves.

71
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:12,149
By the time I thought to give up the endeavour, the door had closed behind me.

72
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,467
And thusly do we come to the present moment.

73
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:20,240
Well, there's no way we're getting into that storage room without another ring.

74
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,400
It's part of a locking mechanism that controls the door.

75
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,339
I'll grant you that adds a heretofore undiscussed
level of complexity to the proceedings.

76
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,339
You said something about an artefact?

77
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,350
Indeed!

78
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,567
That storage room is brimming with treasures from the Old Ones.

79
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,554
But one in particular caught my eye.

80
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,669
An intricate looking glass!

81
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,450
I've only seen one such device before.

82
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,914
My old mum brought one back for me from … from …

83
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,546
… wherever she got to that time.

84
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:58,132
I remember holding it, staring into its face, seeing myself and…

85
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,129
…and my mother just over my shoulder, smiling.

86
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,575
And one of these looking glasses it's in the storage room?

87
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,523
Oh, yes, I'm quite sure.

88
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:13,100
I peered into that dim little chamber and there it was.

89
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,862
I've wanted to find for so long, I…

90
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,450
How're we gonna get that ring?

91
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,252
Two sets of hands, girl. Two sets of hands!

92
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:25,349
Behind us lie a pair of enormous gates.

93
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,356
But I believe the gates must be operated in tandem.

94
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,052
Together we can dry this place out.

95
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,408
Guess we'd better get started then.

96
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,669
I guess we'd better!

97
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,000
GILDUN: Up ahead, girl, see the valve?

98
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,808
GILDUN: Time to put our hands to use.

99
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,350
GILDUN: I'll take care of this one.

100
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,539
GILDUN: There's another valve on the other side to lock the gate in place.

101
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,250
GILDUN: Would you mind heading across and, er, doing the honours?

102
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,262
GILDUN: You know, I'm reminded of a delve I undertook out near The Claim.

103
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:33,086
GILDUN: A stone ruin, cloud-tall and lake-wide.

104
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,746
GILDUN: Must have been thirteen levels on that monstrosity, but no walls.

105
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,456
GILDUN: Just great stone columns bearing the weight of the level above.

106
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:46,954
GILDUN: Filled out with row upon row
of those enormous, rusted-out Old World carts.

107
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,736
GILDUN: You know the ones with four wheels?

108
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,726
GILDUN: I've scraped through a hundred of those carts.

109
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,670
GILDUN: But the only things I've ever seen inside is birds nests.

110
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,222
GILDUN: You don't suppose that's what they're for do you?

111
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,115
ALOY: A tub of stagnant water, charming.

112
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,203
GILDUN: Why would the Old Ones want to cart around families of birds?

113
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,330
GILDUN: Marvellous, you made it!

114
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,701
GILDUN: Now grab that valve and give it a spin!

115
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:25,899
ALOY: On it.

116
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,789
GILDUN: A little more now and I should be able to get the blasted thing moving.

117
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,360
ALOY: There, you should be able to lower the gate.

118
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,528
GILDUN: Right you are.

119
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:42,509
GILDUN: Now, when I get this gate down, you'll need to turn the valve again.

120
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:45,700
GILDUN: Gotta lock this thing in place.

121
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,583
ALOY: One gate down!

122
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,259
GILDUN: Halfway through then, aren't we? To the second gate!

123
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,299
GILDUN: A ladder is a rare and special thing, girl.

124
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,000
GILDUN: You can depend on it to take you
exactly where you need to go and no further.

125
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,757
GILDUN: Hmm, I'd wager the valves for the 
second sluice gate are somewhere above us.

126
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,950
GILDUN: But how are we gonna get up there?

127
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,903
ALOY: Let me look around, see what I can find.

128
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:41,388
ALOY: Looks like I could jump across on that rickety rusting platform.

129
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,718
ALOY: Might find a way up.

130
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,659
GILDUN: Nice jump!

131
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,590
GILDUN: [laughs] Nice, what am I saying? That was stupendous!

132
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,339
GILDUN: I've never seen such absolute disregard for personal safety.

133
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,616
ALOY: Thanks, I think?

134
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:15,450
GILDUN: Oh, you're close, girl. Just spring across the gap.

135
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,490
GILDUN: Ha?! You're right above me!

136
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,450
Just send that ladder on down.

137
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,147
ALOY: Look out below!

138
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,168
GILDUN: Now we've done this once before.

139
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,649
GILDUN: Should be as easy as falling down a hole.

140
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,850
GILDUN: If you take the valve on the other side…

141
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:42,056
ALOY: If it's set up the same way on this side, I should look for an access tunnel.

142
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,933
GILDUN: This? This is my sort of delve.

143
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,192
GILDUN: A thousand little problems to solve.

144
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,871
GILDUN: A million minute and invisible factors.

145
00:15:54,363 --> 00:16:00,167
GILDUN: My father used to say to me "Gildling"
— he'd call me Gildling — "Gildling" he used to say,

146
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:03,656
GILDUN: "Don't make the delve harder than it needs to be."

147
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:07,492
GILDUN: "The best delves are done in
half the time it takes a campfire to sputter out."

148
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,705
GILDUN: Now, my father was a great man, mind you.

149
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:15,458
GILDUN: But dead wrong when it came
to choosing a rubric by which to judge delve quality.

150
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,913
GILDUN: To find yourself stuck, then unstuck.

151
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:21,718
GILDUN: To fail, then succeed.

152
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:25,385
GILDUN: To get lost, and to find yourself.

153
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,942
GILDUN: That's what makes a delve!

154
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:29,334
ALOY: Uh-huh, Gildun.

155
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,649
ALOY: Okay, Gildun, turn the valve!

156
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,049
GILDUN: It's not working!

157
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,611
GILDUN: Damn thing's too heavy.

158
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,388
GILDUN: Glance behind me, would you?

159
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:13,644
GILDUN: See anything big and, er, broken?

160
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,640
ALOY: Looks like part of the counterweight broke off.

161
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,035
ALOY: If I can get up there, my weight might be enough to get it moving again.

162
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,141
ALOY: Hang on, okay? I've got a plan.

163
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,593
ALOY: I need to get up higher.

164
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:30,267
ALOY: Could climb up that wreckage, that's pretty much what I do now.

165
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,446
ALOY: Can't jump straight to the counterweight from here.

166
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,863
ALOY: But I could climb higher, get above it.

167
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,674
GILDUN: Stop! The drop's too far, girl!

168
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:19,437
GILDUN: Oh, [laughs] controlled falling, very clever.

169
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:22,915
ALOY: Going down!

170
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,409
ALOY: Almost low enough to jump.

171
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,269
GILDUN: You can make it!

172
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,767
GILDUN: Let's see another one of those mad leaps! Haha!

173
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,349
ALOY: Got it. We're good to go.

174
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,759
GILDUN: You were a sight to see.

175
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:06,851
GILDUN: Bounding from metal rust trap to metal rust trap. [laughs]

176
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,388
GILDUN: Still a bit of water, but low enough wouldn't you say?

177
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:12,989
GILDUN: Now then, er, where is that ring?

178
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:16,931
ALOY: Good question. Well, at least I should be able to swim now.

179
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:22,640
GILDUN: Snapmaw! It's a Snapmaw! Very, very big Snapmaw!

180
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,125
ALOY: I see it, Gildun!

181
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,328
GILDUN: Very big, very, very big.

182
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:28,029
ALOY: Just stay out of the way!

183
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:05,158
GILDUN: Forge forgive me, what if that Snapmaw swallowed that ring we're after?

184
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:08,301
GILDUN: Just gobbled it right up?

185
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,549
ALOY: We'll find out after I've killed it!

186
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,329
GILDUN: Is it dead? Just tell me when it'd dead, would you?

187
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:37,480
ALOY: It's dead.

188
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,549
GILDUN: Ha! Marvellous.

189
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,779
GILDUN: So the uh ring, maybe if you pry its jaws open and reach inside.

190
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,160
GILDUN: I can't look.

191
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:22,582
ALOY: You were right, this thing did swallow the ring.

192
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:27,412
GILDUN: Haha! That's the old Gildun intuition in action!

193
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,309
GILDUN: It's never led me astray.

194
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,049
GILDUN: Sure, it's chosen routes could be a bit circuitous, but…

195
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:37,527
GILDUN: Never mind! To the storage room! To the spoils!

196
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,328
GILDUN: Ooh, what's in here?

197
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:43,566
GILDUN: More old world treasures perhaps?

198
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:46,265
GILDUN: This place is full of surprises.

199
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,269
GILDUN: Could we have a look?

200
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,229
ALOY: Didn't you want to get into the storage room?

201
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,118
GILDUN: I do, fervently!

202
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:56,463
GILDUN: But, well, I got time to poke my nose in if you do.

203
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,709
ALOY: We drained enough water for what we need to do, but…

204
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,679
ALOY: I wonder if I could empty out the whole dam.

205
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,119
ALOY: Pipes, valves, maybe I can drain the rest of the water from here.

206
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,660
ALOY: Perhaps my Focus can help me.

207
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,849
ALOY: Sure are a lot of valves.

208
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,160
ALOY: Should check my Focus first.

209
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:49,598
ALOY: Alright, time to get the flow going to the right place.

210
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:53,713
GILDUN: I say this as a man typically enamoured of complexities, but…

211
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,859
GILDUN: This looks like it might be a little much for me.

212
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,295
ALOY: Don't worry, I think I've got this.

213
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,549
GILDUN: Music to my ears! To each job its proper tools.

214
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,078
GILDUN: Toothpicks make horrible arrows as the saying goes.

215
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,549
ALOY: That's not quite right.

216
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,349
ALOY: Looks like I'm on the right track.

217
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:54,259
ALOY: Something's not right.

218
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,289
GILDUN: You got a competent mind, girl.

219
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,769
GILDUN: A mind for nuance and finesse.

220
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:15,768
GILDUN: Not I, no indeed. Not Old Gildun.

221
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,950
ALOY: There, one step closer.

222
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,640
GILDUN: This job demands a certain degree of patience, doesn't it?

223
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,319
GILDUN: I'm afraid I inherited my mother's restlessness.

224
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:57,460
ALOY: Getting there.

225
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,759
GILDUN: You've been at this a while, girl.

226
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,400
GILDUN: No room to judge, mind.

227
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,116
ALOY: There, that should do it.

228
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:34,159
ALOY: I should head back and see if that took care of the rest of the water.

229
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,059
GILDUN: Got it working, did you?

230
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,150
GILDUN: [laughs] Of course you did!

231
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,693
GILDUN: Never met a conundrum you couldn't unconundrum, have ya?

232
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:45,601
ALOY: The door's open. Guess it had sealed because of the flooding.

233
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,509
ALOY: This must go down to the lower level.

234
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,250
ALOY: Ugh, it stinks down here.

235
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,450
GILDUN: [sniffs] Mmm-mmm, you smell that?

236
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,973
GILDUN: Smells like a forgeside morning in The Claim.

237
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:59,140
RECORDING: LAURA: See? Check this out!

238
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,009
RECORDING: LAURA: We can just bang on this pipe, you know?
 [banging sounds]

239
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,691
RECORDING: SHELLEY: Could we sample that, or…?

240
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:10,852
RECORDING: LAURA: Totally, like what about after the… uh, sorry, just a sec.

241
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:13,753
RECORDING: SHELLEY: Laura?

242
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,189
RECORDING: LAURA: I, uh…

243
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,866
RECORDING: LAURA: I need to take a break.

244
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:24,124
RECORDING: SHELLEY: Laura? Hey! Laura!

245
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,997
ALOY: Looks like that's everything. I should head back up with Gildun.

246
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,950
GILDUN: So, as we circle back around to the matter of the supply room.

247
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,909
GILDUN: I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait!

248
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,349
GILDUN: Almost there!

249
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,160
GILDUN: Soon I'll hold the looking glass in my hand, just like mom and I used to.

250
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,773
GILDUN: Err, what, um…?

251
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,950
GILDUN: What are you doing with your hands there, girl?

252
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:11,160
GILDUN: [laughs] I can't believe that worked!

253
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,400
GILDUN: I thought you'd lost your mind, tickling the empty air like that.

254
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,699
Gildun? Everything okay?

255
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,549
I was so sure I saw it.

256
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,789
The looking glass.

257
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,349
I was so sure.

258
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,349
Right there in the window.

259
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:28,769
I would…

260
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:35,660
Of course, a trick of the light. Nothing at all.

261
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,646
I'm sorry, Gildun. It must have meant a lot to you.

262
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:47,994
Oh well, much as any artefact of the Old Ones would mean to me, really.

263
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,030
It's fine, I'm fine.

264
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,578
Besides, what are the spoils compared to the delve?

265
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,049
That's why we do it, girl!

266
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:00,539
The delve, not the treasure.

267
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,319
And what a delve it was!

268
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,883
By the great blazing forge, I'll never forget that.

269
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:12,626
Now then I, uh, believe we have some repairs to make.

270
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,759
RECORDING: SHELLEY: I mean, this is it.

271
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,829
RECORDING: SHELLEY: We get to play together, what, maybe two more times?

272
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:35,395
RECORDING: LAURA: Nah, Shells. Farewell tour! Reunion tour in like, six months.

273
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:37,237
RECORDING: LAURA: Bands do it all the time.

274
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,649
RECORDING: SHELLEY: For our adoring fans?

275
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,073
RECORDING: LAURA: It's not that hard to stay in touch, Shelley.

276
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,198
RECORDING: LAURA: We could practice in holospace.

277
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,894
RECORDING: SHELLEY: People always say that.

278
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,450
Okay, let's fix the panel and shut this place down.

279
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,715
GILDUN: Ohhh that's a whole lot prettier, isn't it?

280
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,182
[laughs]

281
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,099
What does it mean?

282
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,579
It means it worked.

283
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,353
By the forge, you are a wonder!

284
00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:58,939
Do you hear that often? I'll hazard a guess you do.

285
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,589
I've heard something like that once or twice.

286
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,300
Oh, she's modest now?

287
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,022
A master of the arts of the Old Ones, a delver to shame the entire Claim!

288
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:10,170
And she wants to be modest. Ha!

289
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,289
It's not like I did it alone, Gildun.

290
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:18,960
No. No, I suppose not.

291
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,693
So what's next for you, on your way back to The Claim?

292
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:27,206
And deprive the people of Song's Edge the story of this encounter?

293
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:28,710
Perish the thought!

294
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,644
I'll stay there a while longer.

295
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:34,349
But a story is best told by all who encountered it.

296
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,659
Come and lend a hand, won't you?

297
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,251
COMPUTER: Overflow basin empty, interior accessible.

298
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,189
COMPUTER: Minimal flood damage.

299
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:53,138
ALOY: Sounds like the basin has dried out too, maybe I'll take a look.

300
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,999
GILDUN: Another adventure so soon? You're braver than me!

301
00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:00,190
GILDUN: But there was no question of that. [laughs]

302
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,679
GILDUN: You go on ahead.

303
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,250
GILDUN: I'm gonna stand right here and bask in our victory for a while longer.

304
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,349
Water's lower.

305
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:59,440
And going by that sound, I think Laulai's already at the Din.

306
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,349
It's an animal figurine.

307
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,539
The shape looks familiar.

308
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,179
She wasn't kidding about the sound.

309
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,031
I've been seen.

310
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,269
It felt that!

311
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,027
Right on target.

312
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,349
It'd be fascinating if they weren't looking for me.

313
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,230
That hurt it!

314
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,940
Must be the entrance to this "Din".

315
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:17,559
Ouch!

316
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,573
RECORDING: LAURA: Live from the illustrious Overflow Basin Studios

317
00:48:36,573 --> 00:48:42,847
RECORDING: LAURA: it's Concrete Beach Party!
A-one, a-two, a-one-two-three-four!

318
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,113
You look happy to be playing again.

319
00:49:31,113 --> 00:49:34,878
I don't know what you did, but the water drained in the snap of a short song.

320
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,800
What do you think of the music?

321
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:39,389
I've never heard anything else like it.

322
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:45,734
That's because there's no other place with such resonance,
such intonation that rattles your ribs with its power.

323
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:50,179
And of course, no-one else knows these pipes like I do.

324
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,389
I learned them by ear before I could walk, strapped to my father's back.

325
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,055
Thank you for draining the waters.

326
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:02,800
Not just for myself, but for my ancestors and their songs.

327
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:08,710
Please, take this as a token of our gratitude.

328
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,342
LAULAI: Let's see, what shall I play next?

329
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:33,401
LAULAI: The echoes are different off wet stone, sound is warmer.

330
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:39,670
LAULAI: The sound of the pipes fills my heart with joy and sadness all at once.
