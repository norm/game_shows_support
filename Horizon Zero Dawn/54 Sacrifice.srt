1
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,657
Turn your face to the Sun, child.

2
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,739
HELIS: My entire life I've always known one thing with prophetic certainty.

3
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,650
HELIS: That I was destined for glory as a great champion of the Sun.

4
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,010
HELIS: Even when Jiran was murdered,
even when Meridian fell, I never doubted my destiny.

5
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,930
HELIS: Until you came along.

6
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:30,000
HELIS: When I heard that you had survived a doubt took root in my mind.

7
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,500
HELIS: As sure as the sun rises and falls each day, those I am bade to kill die.

8
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:42,172
HELIS: And yet I failed. How? Why?

9
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,099
HELIS: With each dig site you attacked,
each loyal soldier you killed, this pestering doubt grew.

10
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,340
It grew when High Priest Bahavas went missing.

11
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,564
And when the true Sun-King Itamen was snatched away.

12
00:01:57,104 --> 00:02:00,549
It not only grew but multiplied.

13
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,649
I kept thinking of the moment my knife pierced your throat.

14
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:11,580
One twist, a simple tug of the blade, and you would have bled out.

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,605
In slaughter I am a practised hand, so why hesitate?

16
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,849
Why fail my destined purpose?

17
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,960
See that scar on your cheek?

18
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,689
You didn't get to finish.

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,349
Yes, I remember.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,771
He fought well for a savage.

21
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,889
His name was Rost and he was a better man than you could ever hope to be!

22
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,610
The better man is the one who doesn't
end up with his guts steaming on the ground.

23
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,740
No, it wasn't him.

24
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,866
I could have finished you before he attacked, but I didn't.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,949
I guess even a monster like you can have a glimmer of conscience.

26
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,800
"Turn your face to the sun, child."

27
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,680
Dressing up murder as religious sacrifice so you could feel better about it?

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,150
No, I never doubted the righteousness of killing you.

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,949
And yet, your words touch close to the truth.

30
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,962
In my heart, I deemed the order to kill you unworthy of me.

31
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:27,025
You were just a savage girl; so I thought at the time.

32
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,563
Even still, I aimed to kill you and yet did not.

33
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:41,734
This failing troubled my thoughts, haunted every step.

34
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:55,163
It was only when I captured you, down in that place, that I finally glimpsed
the Sun's design etched at length across the course of events.

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,750
You were meant to survive that day on the mountain.

36
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,750
Meant to interfere at dig sites and kill my men.

37
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,905
Meant to eliminate High Priest Bahavas.

38
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:10,276
Meant to snatch Itamen away.

39
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:14,849
Conversely, I was meant to capture you.

40
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,850
Here.

41
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,649
So that you might die as a sacrificial offering to the Sun.

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,300
Everything as it was meant to be, predestined and preordained.

43
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,959
Spare me the religious justifications.

44
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,338
You can dress up your cruelty in holy clothes and words if you want.

45
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,360
But under it all, you're just a murderer.

46
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,800
An odd slight coming from you.

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,750
You've become quite a murderer yourself, child.

48
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,790
A killer of killers, not a murderer.

49
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,889
But I wouldn't expect you to know the difference.

50
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:02,550
All this talk of destiny and fate,
I'm sure Hades speaks the same language, doesn't he?

51
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,850
You're being played for a fool.

52
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,980
It'd be laughable if there weren't so much killing involved.

53
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,389
Hades is an ancient machine, not the Buried Shadow of Carja myth.

54
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,689
It doesn't care about Meridian.

55
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,579
It wants to kill everything and everyone.

56
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,670
And you are its dutiful slave.

57
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,550
I serve not the Buried Shadow, but the Sun in shadow.

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,770
All halves of nature joined to one cause, shadow to sun, dark to light.

59
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,110
Do you really not hear how ridiculous that sounds?

60
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,939
You've gone from serving an insane homicidal Sun-King
to an insane homicidal machine.

61
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:48,350
You're moving down in the world, not up.

62
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,781
I'll remember those words as I watch your corpse burn.

63
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,509
Whatever's left of it.

64
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,079
If you're gonna go on babbling like this all night, could you just kill me now?

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,590
Oh, no, we're in no hurry you and I, not now.

66
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,610
Maybe some physical torture to distract me from your voice?

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,228
You fail to grasp the point.

68
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:18,050
As surely as you've been conquered, so has all doubt.

69
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,143
And with certainty of belief comes unstoppable force.

70
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,489
Then open this cage and put your faith to the test.

71
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,899
See if things work out like you expect.

72
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,089
The circle has closed.

73
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,769
Every element is in its proper place, exactly where it belongs.

74
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,470
The errant beast, now caged, will serve her true purpose.

75
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,300
A sacrificial animal.

76
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, speaking of sacrifice, I forgot to tell you.

77
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:57,117
After you crashed the Eclipse network, I sent messengers into the east.

78
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:02,089
To rally the forces there and mount an invasion of the "sacred land".

79
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,810
I ordered every Nora killed.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,366
I was hoping to catch you there, but, alas, it all seems to have been unnecessary.

81
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,067
Why butcher dozens of innocents for no gain? It's a waste of effort.

82
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,353
You're right. I won't even be there to enjoy it.

83
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,949
The Nora cast me out at birth.

84
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,209
You're not hurting me if you hurt them.

85
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,810
Really? Then it makes no difference one way or another.

86
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,604
You're an idiot. A dangerous idiot, but an idiot.

87
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,310
I couldn't recall the order even if I wished to.

88
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:45,850
Thanks to your destruction of the network,
communication over distances is impossible.

89
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,350
You not only doomed yourself but an entire tribe.

90
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,550
Do we not see the scorching judgement of the Sun in these events?

91
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,389
Your Focus. Such a powerful device, isn't it?

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,439
And yet so fragile.

93
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,217
Ah.

94
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:23,149
So you see, this time I did not hesitate.

95
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,009
The knife has already been twisted.

96
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:58,283
[crowd chanting and cheering]

97
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:02,039
HELIS: Carja faithful, rejoice!

98
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,149
Our years in shadow are over!

99
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,272
A new dawn trembles on the horizon!

100
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:11,419
A new day soon to break!

101
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:20,000
And when it does the false Sun-King will be dead,
and Holy Meridian ours once more!

102
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,100
[crowd cheering]
HELIS: In this I have become an instrument of prophecy.

103
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,632
All halves of nature joined to one cause.

104
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:36,731
Shadow to sun, light to dark, night to day.

105
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,419
Behold!

106
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,440
Hold your seats!

107
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,679
Can you not see the proof of the Sun's blessing before your eyes?

108
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:58,639
HELIS: How else could shadows such as these prowl in broad light of day?

109
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,549
HELIS: Were they not approved by the Sun and joined to our cause?

110
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,891
HELIS: Many years ago, to consecrate this great ring…

111
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:15,378
HELIS: …the Radiant Jiran ordered
many faithless crushed beneath the hooves of a Behemoth.

112
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,000
HELIS: Mighty is the Behemoth in the eye of the Sun.

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,439
HELIS: But it is mightier still infused with the power of shadow.

114
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:30,503
HELIS: Let this one who schemed and slivered be the first to die!

115
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,300
[crowd cheering]

116
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,490
Let her be the first of thousands! 

117
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,360
I'll never beat that thing without weapons.

118
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,149
Gotta get out of the way.

119
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,420
All my weapons are up on the platform, and there's no way out of this ring.

120
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,239
One more pillar and that platform will come down, and my weapons with it!

121
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,467
ALOY: That did it!

122
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:34,619
Hey! Guess who got her weapons back!

123
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,949
Now you're just a big, dumb target.

124
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,375
Come and get it!

125
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,614
Silence!

126
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,534
Shadows, kill her!

127
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,297
KILL HER!

128
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,539
Why leave it to them? Come get me yourself!

129
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,921
Sylens?

130
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,882
TRAITOR!

131
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,002
So you're here. Really here.

132
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,649
You risked your life.

133
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,149
Of course I did.

134
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,120
How did you track my location when I wasn't wearing a Focus?

135
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,923
Really, Aloy.

136
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:27,332
It doesn't take a genius to surmise
that Helis would throw you into the Sun-Ring at high noon.

137
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:29,889
Helis recognised you back in the Sun-Ring.

138
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,889
You told me that you assisted the Eclipse.

139
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,142
Not that you knew the man who killed my…

140
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,149
Who almost killed me.

141
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,809
So now you know.

142
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,889
The man is a serious threat.

143
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,900
So let's do all we can to make sure that he and Hades don't succeed.

144
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:48,559
Right.

145
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,100
I wore out two Striders getting here in time, but I did.

146
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,678
Since when can you override machines?

147
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,259
Ever since you discovered the technique.

148
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,680
I had to destroy a Corruptor to obtain the necessary parts, of course.

149
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,049
But your example showed me how to do that as well.

150
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,759
Yet another benefit of monitoring your activities through your Focus.

151
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,937
Truth be told, the underlying logic of the technique
isn't so different from rites practices by Banuk Shamans.

152
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,849
Though, of course, far more advanced.

153
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,628
Great. You're welcome, I guess.

154
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:27,880
If you'd been killed, the Nora's sacred mountain
would never have given up its secrets.

155
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,254
Too bad you wasted your time then.

156
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:34,759
Helis destroyed my Focus and the Alpha Registry with it.

157
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,069
Not at all.

158
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,291
The whole time I've been monitoring your Focus,
I've duplicated every data file you've scanned.

159
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,691
Installing that data to a new Focus was trivially easy.

160
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,226
"Happy birthday, Isaac. Daddy sure does love his little big man."

161
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,799
You're really good at making it impossible to like you, Sylens.

162
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,309
But I guess I need this.

163
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,259
It's time to see where you were born.

164
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,640
Maybe you'll even learn why.

165
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,419
Yeah, "meet the machine that birthed me into this world."

166
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,809
Isn't that how you put it?

167
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,881
When you were recovering The Alpha Registry
down in the Zero Dawn bunker I was needlessly cruel.

168
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:19,410
For your sake, I hope there is someone waiting there for you inside the mountain.

169
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,544
Not a what, but a who.

170
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,289
Helis ordered an Eclipse detachment to attack the Nora's Sacred Land.

171
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,400
The tribe's already weak, they won't stand a chance. You should come with me.

172
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,285
Oh, absolutely not. I have preparations to make elsewhere.

173
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,599
What kind of… hmph, why do I bother asking?

174
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,134
You're not gonna tell me.

175
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,826
When the time is right I'll be in touch.

176
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,849
I'll contact you later.

177
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,141
In the meantime, should you need to return
to Shadow Carja territory I brought armour to conceal your identity.

178
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,359
You think of everything, don't you?

179
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,890
One of us has to.

180
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,210
Now be on your way.

181
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,309
Yah!

182
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:38,735
Another day, what'll this one hold?

183
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,259
They're scanning for me.

184
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:04,420
Well, I guess I can't blame you for that.

185
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,539
Let's see you catch us!

186
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,580
Always watching.

187
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,049
That smell, trees on fire.

188
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,151
The Embrace!

189
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,206
The Watchtower's burning, but the sentinels had time to warn the tribe.

190
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:19,642
Seeker, you've returned.

191
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,950
Where is everyone?

192
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:31,283
They fell back, took shelter inside the Sacred Mountain.

193
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,710
But the faithless and their demons pursued.

194
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,660
Can I help you?

195
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,590
Please leave me, help others.

196
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,849
I am beyond your help.

197
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:53,542
Go! I will beg the goddess to guide you, Seeker.

198
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,849
MAREA, IN FLASHBACK:
Trying to live up to the glory of the Nora hasn't killed me yet.

199
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,000
MAREA, IN FLASHBACK: But if it has to, I'm willing.

200
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:15,259
Marea. She wasn't one to give up ground.

201
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:19,220
Well she didn't sell her life cheaply.

202
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,814
In the end I guess that's all any of us can hope for.

203
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,309
Let's get on with it!

204
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,768
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

205
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,610
The Nora made a stand here.

206
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,730
Anything to protect the Embrace.

207
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,440
But the gates couldn't hold.

208
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,245
This is Hades' future, metal and ash.

209
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:17,039
The Embrace, it's … it's devastated!

210
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,668
For years, this … this was my entire world.

211
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,387
It can be destroyed in… in hours?

212
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:39,725
No birdsong. I've never heard the Embrace so quiet, so dead.

213
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,840
Got their attention!

214
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,710
ECLIPSE: Who's firing at me?

215
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,370
ECLIPSE: Huh?

216
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,921
ECLIPSE: I can hear you, I think—

217
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,060
You can see them, they can't see you.

218
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,309
ECLIPSE: She's coming for us!

219
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,763
That's right, no-one here.

220
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:16,610
Another battle, another defeat.

221
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,304
The Eclipse smashed through.

222
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,210
ECLIPSE: Got eyes—

223
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,449
ECLIPSE: Here!

224
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,079
Haven't you got anything better to do?

225
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,136
ECLIPSE: You cannot escape!

226
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,670
ECLIPSE: Eh?

227
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:32,866
ECLIPSE: The Sun can't save you now!

228
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:40,289
More Eclipse.

229
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,059
It's a Corrupted Thunderjaw, alright.

230
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,469
The survivors must be holed up in the mountain.

231
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,196
If the tunnel collapses, they'll be buried.

232
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,750
And I'll never reach the hatch.

233
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:00,607
ECLIPSE: That's right, bring down the mountain!
