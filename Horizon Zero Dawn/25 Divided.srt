1
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,549
Ahh, the machine riding Nora with the special spear. 

2
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,049
How lucky to come across you.

3
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,159
I have a proposal.

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,650
Come closer.

5
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,000
Call me Fernund.

6
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,310
Hey, Fernund, my eyes are up here.

7
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm looking at your spear.

8
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,576
It's magnificent.

9
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,750
But how does it work?

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,290
You stick the pointy end into the machine.

11
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,609
Yes, but, how does it turn foe into friend?

12
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,151
It's simple really.

13
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,599
Yes?

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,129
You wouldn't understand.

15
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,950
What's your proposal?

16
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,448
During the reign of that idiot Carja king
outlanders often hid items of value from raiders.

17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,939
Well, I found one.

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,349
What is it?

19
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,949
A relic from the Old Ones.

20
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,259
You probably would understand it better than I do.

21
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,638
Unfortunately, it's too high for me to reach.

22
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,979
Uh-huh, and you want me to get it for you?

23
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,300
What a brilliant plan!

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,505
You're a much better climber than I am, to be sure.

25
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:34,810
Get it, bring it back, and we'll split the proceeds.

26
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,100
How about I see what it is first?

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,580
That works too.

28
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,479
What do you do exactly?

29
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,059
I'm a trader of fine tinkerings. I buy low, sell high.

30
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,469
But in this case, you wouldn't be buying.

31
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,060
Sometimes I "find" tinkerings as well.

32
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,889
Let's say I'm interested.

33
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,270
What do I need to do?

34
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,801
The relic rests on the rise of Dusk Mesa.

35
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:04,349
Bring it to me at the Meridian docks and we will both profit.

36
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,159
Leave me alone, girl.

37
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,550
Can't you see I'm searching the water?

38
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,168
Okay. What's wrong? Has someone fallen in?

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,300
No.

40
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,670
Have you seen a girl of about seventeen?

41
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,449
I can't even say it.

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,649
Are you afraid she jumped to her death?

43
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,370
I don't know!

44
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,949
Elida, my only daughter, she's gone!

45
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,060
Who else is searching for her?

46
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,634
I demanded the guards look for her,
but I can't put my hope in them.

47
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:42,101
They say girls run off all the time at this age.

48
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,790
Not my Elida.

49
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,470
I've reached out to her friends.

50
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,838
But they say they haven't seen her in weeks.

51
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,240
Weeks!

52
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,209
How could I not know?

53
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:54,639
I've searched everywhere.

54
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,560
And then I thought maybe she might be…

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,250
…here, in the water.

56
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,050
Has she done or said anything unusual?

57
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,649
She's been like a different person.

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,720
She used to be such a happy girl,
playing in the dirt with the boys.

59
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,350
What changed?

60
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't know.

61
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,239
She disagrees with me about everything.

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,649
Hates the ceasefire.

63
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
Thinks we never should have fought the war to begin with.

64
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,703
It's been a month since I've seen her smile,
she spends so much time in her room.

65
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,800
I should have paid more attention.

66
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,810
Did something happen during the war that upset her?

67
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,519
The war upset us all.

68
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,850
The cruelty, the Mad Sun-King, the blood on the streets.

69
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,050
When Itamen's men fled, they stormed through here.

70
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,050
There's a ceasefire now, of course,
but Elida broods about it more than ever.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,449
It bothers her that our people are so divided.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,708
I'm a good tracker, I could look for her.

73
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,310
Where did you last see her?

74
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,089
Just last night, in the house.

75
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,689
She seemed better.

76
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,449
Was she ill?

77
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,560
She seemed withdrawn.

78
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,850
Sad.

79
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,050
So I was pleased when she wanted to go out in the garden.

80
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,680
That's the last I saw of her.

81
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,850
I'll do my best.

82
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,649
May the Sun light your way.

83
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,089
[Carja guard]
Move along, you have no need to loiter around here.

84
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:45,438
[Carja guard]
I'm awake, and alert.

85
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,701
Looks like Elida left a few things behind.

86
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,980
Aren't these for spying far away?

87
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,079
[Carja merchant]
You won't find better wares.

88
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,379
What's in this bottle?

89
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,759
I guess she was doing some gardening.

90
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,265
Ugh, it smells like ash or rotten eggs.

91
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,050
Better pour that out.

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,600
Why would you need a spyglass in the garden?

93
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,089
Something buried.

94
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,850
No, something dug up.

95
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,250
Must have left a trail.

96
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:08,637
[Carja guard]
Some Oseram girl applied to the city guard the other day. Amazing.

97
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:11,743
[Carja merchant]
Buy what you need, leave the rest.

98
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,782
[Carja villager]
You should be proud of what you've done for us.

99
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,279
Flower petals.

100
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,050
Why would she take flowers from her own garden?

101
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
[Lahavis]
Did you find anything in the garden?

102
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,949
Nothing definite yet. I'll let you know.

103
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:55,062
[Carja merchant]
Would you like to buy something today?

104
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:00,000
[Carja villager]
Dervahl stormed the palace and still he lives?

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,950
[Carja merchant]
Buy what you need, leave the rest.

106
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,049
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up on these goods.

107
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,500
[Carja villager]
He tried to kill the Sun-King, unbelievable!

108
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,539
The petals end here, at the water.

109
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,860
Could her father have been right, but at the wrong place?

110
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,649
Ropes to tie up a boat that isn't here.

111
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,450
Maybe she took the boat to that island over there.

112
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,210
Looks like I'm in for a long swim.

113
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,850
Save these for the trail.

114
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,450
The boat, this looks promising.

115
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,217
Calm, calm.

116
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,370
Is that you?

117
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,750
You did it!

118
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,480
Who are you?

119
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,779
How did you learn to fight like that?

120
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,250
What are you doing on this island?

121
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,509
I come here to be alone.

122
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,955
Do you know your father fears you're dead?

123
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:41,730
Huh, I'm surprised he even noticed I was gone.

124
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,658
He has the whole village looking for you.

125
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,340
He's worried.

126
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,210
The Snapmaw kept me.

127
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,500
You took care of it, so thank you.

128
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,250
I should be fine now.

129
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,250
Why did you bring flowers here?

130
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:55,659
No real reason.

131
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,139
I'm trying to make this a place for us.

132
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,590
For all of us.

133
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,990
Who's "us"?

134
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,809
Is there someone else here?

135
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,749
No. No!

136
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,799
I was going to surprise my friends with what I made.

137
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,620
There's no one else here, obviously.

138
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,049
Let's go back to the village together.

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,100
I need to finish planting my garden.

140
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,750
Just a little more time.

141
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,049
I'll be fine, I promise.

142
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,299
You know, I think I'll take a little more time too, to look around.

143
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,819
You don't need to do that.

144
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,950
I really do.

145
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,970
Bedrools. Two of them.

146
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,480
And a set of cups.

147
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,090
She must not have been alone here.

148
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,269
Looks like Elida has a friend.

149
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,609
Elida, if you came here to be alone, why are there two bedrolls?

150
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,299
And don't lie to me this time.

151
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Um, uh…

152
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,740
…by the Sun, I don't know where he is!

153
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,710
Who?

154
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:42,970
Atral.

155
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,769
He lights a fire signal when it's safe to meet him.

156
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,038
But he's not here.

157
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,259
Who's Atral?

158
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,269
A friend I've known since childhood.

159
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,149
I'd be planting in the garden
and he'd dump worms down my back.

160
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:56,700
I hated that.

161
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,600
But the last few months we'd meet here and…

162
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,750
…everything was different.

163
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,859
We talked for hours.

164
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,720
He help me plant that garden.

165
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,549
I couldn't wait to see him again.

166
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,329
It's like I'm dead and only come alive when I'm here with him.

167
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,789
Do you know what that's like?

168
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:18,432
I can't say that I do.

169
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:23,950
Atral is a soldier for the Carja in Shadow,
stationed at the outpost across the lake.

170
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,950
It's treason for us to even meet.

171
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,339
How could I tell my father?

172
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,950
How could I tell anyone?

173
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,439
Well, then, how did you two arrange to meet here?

174
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,210
We came here as kids.

175
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,149
After he left, I would come back sometimes.

176
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,889
One day I surprised him here.

177
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,460
He smiled from ear to ear.

178
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,658
We sat and played like we had his kids, but…

179
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,850
The war had changed him.

180
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,700
Changed us both.

181
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,929
We weren't kids any more.

182
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,918
We started meeting in secret.

183
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,080
He'd light a fire to signal it was safe for him
to leave his post at the citadel, but…

184
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:02,870
…last night…

185
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,849
He didn't come?

186
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,038
I've been waiting all night and all day.

187
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
I haven't seen anyone but you.

188
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,848
Enough of this, you have to go back.

189
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:15,509
Please, if you came all this way will you look for Atral?

190
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,358
He lit the fire on the island not far from here.

191
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,422
If I go… he could be killed!

192
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,579
We could break the cease fire.

193
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,549
But a Nora wouldn't.

194
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,548
I didn't mean for any of this to happen, I'm so sorry.

195
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,182
I'll find him if I can, as long as you go home to your father.

196
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,139
I will.

197
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,549
Please come find me there.

198
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,849
I can't sleep.

199
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:42,559
I can't breathe knowing Atral could be out there, hurting.

200
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,160
Here's what's left of the fire.

201
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,759
Looks like some sort of scuffle.

202
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Ending with someone being dragged away.

203
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:40,961
[distant cries of pain]

204
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,596
[in the distance]
Hey, speak up or I'll cut off the other finger.

205
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,250
[in the distance]
Who were you signalling?

206
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:51,847
[cries of pain]

207
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,059
That must be Atral!

208
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,769
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Sick of hearing him scream, wanna hear him talk.

209
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:07,916
[Aloy]
Quite a few guards there.

210
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,709
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Hard to believe that thing fought alongside us.

211
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,809
[Aloy]
Maybe there's another way in?

212
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,059
[Shadow Carja soldier]
I tell ya, traitors are everywhere.

213
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,450
[Shadow Carja soldier]
I don't know about that.

214
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,140
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Sure, soon as it gets a little hard, people give up.

215
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,150
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Wanna do the easy thing instead of the right thing.

216
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,150
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Listen to him.

217
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,539
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Doesn't sound easy. He's been at it for hours.

218
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,299
[Shadow Carja soldier]
I guarantee he lit that fire to signal his Meridian pals to come and save him.

219
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,414
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Sit back in the capital. Easy as you please.

220
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:40,200
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Hear they've got plenty of food over there.

221
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,971
[Shadow Carja soldier]
So what if they do? Doesn't make 'em right.

222
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,220
[Shadow Carja soldier]
No monstrous darkness should keep us f…

223
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:37,187
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Never seen a man take a beating like that, and he still won't talk.

224
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,195
Let's do this!

225
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,466
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Got someone to fight here.

226
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:01,680
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Don't let me die.

227
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,539
[Shadow Carja soldier]
The word of Shadow…

228
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,630
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Gonna make you pay for that.

229
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,809
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Take the fight to them, you miserable chuff!

230
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,530
[Shadow Carja soldier]
That hurt!

231
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,160
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Let this deliver the final blow!

232
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,430
[Shadow Carja soldier]
I'm down!

233
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,170
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Stay in shadow!

234
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,803
Calm…

235
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,861
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Look out, someone's up there.

236
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,143
[Shadow Carja soldier]
…war, chasing rats.

237
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,426
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Help me, fools!

238
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:12,646
[Shadow Carja soldier]
I'm broke, bad.

239
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,936
[Shadow Carja soldier]
Vanished like a blasted Stalker.

240
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,490
Atral!

241
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,613
Elida sent me.

242
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,680
Elida.

243
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,079
I was gonna ask her to leave with me, to go into the outlands.

244
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:06,660
Summer out in the sun where no shadow could reach us.

245
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,609
But we wouldn't have made it.

246
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,549
They would have followed me.

247
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,609
I know now.

248
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:17,140
Elida!

249
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:21,950
Tell her they never learned about our island.

250
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,079
She's safe.

251
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,200
Give her this.

252
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,349
Tell her it's worth it.

253
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,849
Poor Atral.

254
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:40,359
And poor Elida.

255
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,909
[Carja]
- Fish like my new lure, made it from a Grazer coil.
- You'll like what I have for sale, I promise.

256
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,351
[Carja merchants]
- These aren't goods, they're necessities!
- You won't find better wares.

257
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:31,869
[Carja guard]
Words to live by.

258
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,651
[Carja villager]
Could've sworn the other stall was down here. Oh well.

259
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:42,146
[Carja merchants]
- Check out these wares.
- I've got all the best goods here.

260
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,099
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

261
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:46,130
[Carja guard]
Some Oseram girl applied to the…

262
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:04,844
[Carja guard]
Those damn Oseram, stirring up tensions. Keeping my eyes on them.

263
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,849
Elida came back!

264
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,639
She hugged me, said she loved me.

265
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,910
But now she just sits in the garden like she's waiting.

266
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,849
Waiting for what?

267
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,349
Something's not right.

268
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,759
Maybe you could talk to her?

269
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,380
I'll, uh, do my best.

270
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,049
Don't say it.

271
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,420
I know he's gone.

272
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,950
The Shadow Carja found him.

273
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,309
But you should know he never betrayed you.

274
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,789
He wanted you to have this key.

275
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,519
It's a key to the lock he gave me.

276
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,259
He said our lives were locked together.

277
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,349
Thank you for bringing it back

278
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,700
For all you did for us.

279
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,599
He said it was worth it.

280
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,049
All of it.

281
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,849
Are you all right?

282
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
No.

283
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,599
I can't imagine how you're feeling, but you don't have to go it alone.

284
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,789
Your father was crushed when he thought you were dead.

285
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,349
Crushed!

286
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,799
He still treats me like a perfect doll.

287
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:30,470
His prized possession.

288
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,500
No, with Atral gone, I'm all alone.

289
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,910
It isn't worth it.

290
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,849
Wait, Elida.

291
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,950
I was wrong about what Atral said.

292
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,558
He didn't say it was worth it.

293
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,349
He said it is worth it.

294
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,849
All of it.

295
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:57,259
Our losses can feel overwhelming.

296
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,073
But they remind us of our connections to others.

297
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:04,779
To Atral, even to your father.

298
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,670
Atral would have wanted you to remember that, and go on.

299
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,460
I know it.

300
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,750
Now, will you?

301
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,750
I…

302
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,960
I'll try.

303
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,659
Please, let me get your father.

304
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,280
Will you talk to him?

305
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,460
I guess.

306
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,889
I should have given you a token for your kindness in finding Elida.

307
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,369
Is something wrong?

308
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,578
Elida needs you to listen, right now.

309
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:45,250
Go to the garden, quickly.

310
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,429
Uh, I will, at once.

311
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,460
[Carja guard]
Watch out for the Oseram merchants, they'll as soon cheat you as look at you.

312
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,269
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday Sun, words to live by.

313
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,623
[Elida]
It's about Atral, father. He and I were together.

314
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:07,842
[Lahavis]
Atral? Yes, I remember him.

315
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:11,659
From when you two are no taller than the flowers in your mother's garden.

316
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,869
But, he went west.

317
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:16,769
They never found out about us.

318
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:18,550
He didn't tell them.

319
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,347
Even when they…

320
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:24,708
Oh Elida, all that time spent writing edicts, I thought…

321
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:28,550
I thought my work was keeping you safe from this war.

322
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,456
It was all just parchment.

323
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,550
And I could have lost you.

324
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,659
I'm so sorry, Father.

325
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:40,050
I wish I'd known all this time what you were going through.

326
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,869
But we'll…

327
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,139
…I'll be better.

328
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,677
Thank you for this second chance.

329
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,440
[Carja guard]
Machines or bandits try to get past me, they'll have a fight. Mark my words.

330
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:04,469
[Carja guard]
Arrested two for disorderly conduct last night.

331
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,449
[Carja guard]
You don't want to know what they were doing.

332
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,703
[Carja villager]
Oseram scum, sending killers after the Sun-King.

333
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,610
[Carja villager]
I bet those traitorous Oseram…

334
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,713
[Carja villager]
You're in for a treat, it's quite a show.

335
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,809
[Carja guard]
Always stay bright, always stay alert. That's what I say.
