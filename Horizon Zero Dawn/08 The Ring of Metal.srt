1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,850
The rest of the killers are camped inside a "ring of metal".

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,141
Blood spilled calls for blood spilled

3
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,370
If the ground is cursed, then let our vengeance sanctify it.

4
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,381
You blaspheme!

5
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:36,094
Please, War-Chief. Break the taboo!

6
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:38,950
Devil's Grief is a cursed place.

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,829
But maybe Aloy's Seeker blessing can protect us.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,149
I'll send scouts ahead.

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,987
Our force will assemble at the cliff above Red Echoes.

10
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:51,439
And launch our attack from there.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,518
Devil's Grief.

12
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:06,898
Foreboding sight, huh?

13
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:09,322
Don't you ever wonder what it used to look like?

14
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,150
Back when the Old Ones lived here?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,959
You're not like other Nora.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,750
That's what they tell me.

17
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:24,459
War-Chief.

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,950
Our scouts found enemy camps in the ruins,
guarding the approach to the Ring of Metal.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,750
Then we should hit those camps first.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,661
Make sure they stay quiet.

21
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,459
Agreed.

22
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,879
Wipe out the camps and our enemies
in the Ring of Metal won't see us coming.

23
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,882
I'll take out the alarms

24
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:45,900
We'll send Braves to each camp to lie in wait.

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,062
What you start, they'll help finish.

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,349
[Sona]
Braves!

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,370
[Sona]
It is time.

28
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,409
[Sona]
Time to fight!

29
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,169
[Sona]
Time to kill!

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,580
[Sona]
Maybe time to die.

31
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,586
[Sona]
We will regroup there, at the base of the tallest tower.

32
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:22,729
[Sona]
Then to the Ring of Metal and vengeance!

33
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:30,800
[Sona]
Today we break taboo to honour our dead and punish our enemies!

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,259
[Sona]
Blood spilled for blood spilled!

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,139
[cheers]

36
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,259
[Sona]
May All-Mother forgive our trespass.

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,750
[Sona]
And if not, may she lay her wrath solely upon me.

38
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,165
[Sona]
Now, to battle.

39
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:53,966
[cheers and whooping]

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,090
You're taking this pretty well.

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,082
The trespassing on tainted lands thing, I mean.

42
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,539
You think so?

43
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,343
I feel like that silly Carja priest at the Blessing,

44
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,669
quaking under his hood.

45
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,060
[laughs]

46
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,750
That night already feels like a lifetime ago.

47
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,865
You know, we weren't really close, Vala and I.

48
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,349
Always competing for our mother's respect, I guess.

49
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,610
Well, you have mine if it makes any difference.

50
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,139
Thanks.

51
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,045
It does.

52
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,169
But this battle? I'm not doing this for respect.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,297
Yours, or my mother's.

54
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,517
I'm doing it for Vala.

55
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,849
I know she would have done the same for me.

56
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,240
Time to strike.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,489
We'll follow your lead.

58
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,870
That's got their attention.

59
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,006
[in the distance]
Victory for All-Mother!

60
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,674
[in the distance]
For the Sacred Land! For the Nora!

61
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,870
Corruption hurts my skin.

62
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,799
About to get made.

63
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,934
Look at this!

64
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
Ah, she went that-a-way!

65
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,870
[in the distance]
Something up there?

66
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,759
[in the distance]
By the Goddess, get down!

67
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,515
[in the distance]
You will not escape me!

68
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,409
[Nora Brave]
All-Mother be praised!

69
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,899
[Nora Brave]
We are all Braves today.

70
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,759
[Nora Brave]
Sweet victory.

71
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,149
[Nora Brave]
The hunt is over.

72
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,159
[Nora Brave]
We have what we need here.

73
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,000
[in the distance]
Wait, he said. Can't be an instrument of shadow…

74
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:34,301
Okay,

75
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,275
[Cultist]
You cannot escape our hands!

76
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,434
[in the distance]
Here we are!

77
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,369
[Nora Brave]
Fear the Nora!

78
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,840
[Cultist]
I'm after the signal.

79
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,549
[Nora Brave]
Signal fires are death traps.

80
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,759
Haven't you got anything better to do?

81
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,079
[Cultist]
Eyes up!

82
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,359
[Cultist]
She's trying to get over on us!

83
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,039
[Nora Brave]
We did it!

84
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,049
[Nora Brave]
Victory for All-Mother!

85
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,910
[Nora Brave]
Keep them in your sights.

86
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,973
[sounds of fighting]

87
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,150
[Nora Brave]
All-Mother guide me.

88
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,554
[Nora Brave]
We're finished here.

89
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,867
I'll find a use for you.

90
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,359
The camps have been dealt with, now to the Ring of Metal.

91
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,122
Its high walls protect the enemy.

92
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:44,579
We'll have to scale the height under fire if were detected.

93
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,961
I have another idea.

94
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,475
Their base has a weakness.

95
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,109
Send me in alone and I'll exploit it.

96
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,960
If I'm successful, I'll blow a hole in those walls

97
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,279
big enough for the entire War Party to charge through.

98
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,000
Sounds like a plan.

99
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,660
So long as I get to come with you.

100
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,359
A War-Chief should be grateful for two arrows
so eager to spring from the bow.

101
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,740
Yes Varl, go with Aloy as her spear mate.

102
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,335
But … be vigilant.

103
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:17,349
Yes, War Chief, I will.

104
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,544
Go now.

105
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,289
We wait on your signal.

106
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:55,900
[Varl]
You do have a plan, right?

107
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,859
[Aloy]
You followed me this far, even into the ruins.

108
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,309
I thought you trusted me.

109
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,970
[Varl]
I do. But how would you know that this base has a weakness?

110
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,459
[Aloy]
Patience, Varl.

111
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:06,860
We'll know soon enough.

112
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,940
[Aloy]
Up you go.

113
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,259
Take my hand.

114
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,359
[Varl]
Take the one on the right.

115
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:57,759
[Aloy]
I'll take the one on the left.

116
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,539
[Cultist]
What?

117
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,559
[Varl]
Two more. You take the one on the left.

118
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,950
There.

119
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
See their covered shelter?

120
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,044
Do you see those Corruptors?

121
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:37,460
Focus, Varl. That shelter is full of Blaze.

122
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,011
The whole stockpile of it.

123
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,650
If I set it off.

124
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,859
The explosion will destroy those Corruptors
and collapse the wall, too.

125
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,818
A breach for the Nora to charge through.

126
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,369
Can't hit it from here, though.

127
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,626
We'll need to get closer.

128
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,452
I'll get closer.

129
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,759
You head back.

130
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,460
Tell Sona the plan and lead them to that side of the ring.

131
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,849
I'll see it done.

132
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,685
And wen the wall collapses, I'll be first through the breach.

133
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,950
Now all I have to do is make it all happen.

134
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,369
If I can do this quietly, it'll be a lot easier.

135
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,559
Just need to get an angle on that Blaze and shoot it.

136
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,380
Spotted!

137
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:13,552
I'm spotted, I need to get to that Blaze, fast!

138
00:31:14,362 --> 00:31:15,977
[Cultist]
Time to die!

139
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:29,152
[war cries]

140
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,980
[Nora Brave]
Watcher!

141
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,569
[Cultist]
I'll take you down.

142
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,299
[Cultist]
Shoot at me?

143
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,141
[Cultist]
Got one right here!

144
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,427
[Cultist]
I see 'em!

145
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:35,840
[Cultist]
Don't let it end like this, fight!

146
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,170
[Varl]
All-Mother, look upon our victory.

147
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,360
A debt of blood is paid.

148
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,849
Remember this day, brave Nora.

149
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:28,630
[Sona]
From your lips to the Goddess' ears.

150
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,739
Yes, remember it.

151
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:37,202
[cheering]

152
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,280
Be ready to leave this place.

153
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,059
Let your spears and arrows rest in the bodies of the fallen.

154
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,440
They are tainted.

155
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,849
Like these ruins.

156
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:52,869
[Aloy]
It's over.

157
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:54,860
They won't be able to kill again.

158
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,769
The killers, this corruption…

159
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,578
They're all parts of the mystery I'm chasing.

160
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,219
Where the trail leads, I go.

161
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,385
Lucky me!

162
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,130
Just stay out of their way for now.

163
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,539
Nutritious.

164
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,010
And one of these…

165
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:40,807
Got you!

166
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,829
[flashback]
Whatever the corruption is, it doesn't just affect machines.

167
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,570
[flashback]
It burns flesh and sickens the injured.

168
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,332
[flashback]
Do the corrupted machines have any weaknesses?

169
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:14,570
[flashback]
Fire seems to affect them more than ordinary machines.

170
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,840
[flashback]
A small mercy.

171
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:47,448
This is where it ends,

172
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,293
Not much gets past them.

173
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:19,132
The flames, they're burning it!

174
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:30,000
Flames burn stronger than usual.

175
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:14,360
Those machines.

176
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,246
You can see the corruption coming off them like smoke.

177
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:19,021
Time to clear them out.

178
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:17,136
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

179
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:30,059
Keep quiet now.

180
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,019
A Vantage.

181
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:33,340
I wonder what it will show?

182
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:45,515
Apocashitstorm Tour, day five.

183
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:51,170
Gray Swarms opened for Turtle Smash the night I OD'd here.

184
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,570
Or so the police report said, anyway.

185
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,645
I was 15 years old.

186
00:59:55,645 --> 00:59:59,445
When I woke in the hospital, two days later…

187
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,650
your face was the first thing I saw.
