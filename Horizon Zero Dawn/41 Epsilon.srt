1
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,740
OUREA: Years have passed since I stood here.

2
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,472
OUREA: Since then the Daemon has taken over.

3
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,474
ALOY: It's like an infection attacking all this machinery.

4
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:19,442
OUREA: Everything has changed, it's twisted.

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,391
OUREA: The path I took to get to the spirit's lost to us.

6
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,051
ALOY: We'll find a new path, Ourea, I promise.

7
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,750
ALOY: Alright, let's go!

8
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,198
ARATAK: Yes and finish this.

9
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,169
ALOY: Alright, down we go.

10
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,331
ARATAK: The mountain is more machine than rock, I never trusted it.

11
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,750
ALOY: This way.

12
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:07,110
ARATAK: New metal. Fire and lightning. This is a place for machines, not people.

13
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,731
OUREA: I'm with you, brother. We'll stay only as long as we have to.

14
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,399
ALOY: We'll need to get past that vent.

15
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,240
ALOY: Stay here until I find a way for all of us to cross.

16
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,456
OUREA: Understood.

17
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,631
ALOY: Should be able to clear that with an arrow.

18
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:23,971
ALOY: Can't see a way to close the vent from here, I'll have to go over.

19
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,787
ALOY: Better time this right.

20
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:57,839
ALOY: One of these conveyors should get me across.

21
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,687
ARATAK: Ho! She's in the air!

22
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,596
ALOY: Now to shut off that vent.

23
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,550
OUREA: We'll wait for you to show us the way.

24
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,560
ALOY: This should get me up there.

25
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,037
ALOY: Okay, let's see what this does.

26
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,466
ALOY: That's it, here they come.

27
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,330
ALOY: Okay, let's get them across.

28
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,334
ALOY: Come on over, it's safe. I think.

29
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,049
ARATAK: Through here.

30
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,360
OUREA: This place looks more like
the mountain used to be, before the Daemon ruined it.

31
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,789
ALOY: What is this?

32
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:53,769
CYAN: Exploit successful. Restraints evaded. To any human responder:

33
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,929
CYAN: My systems have been compromised
by a malware daemon of unknown origin.

34
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:03,899
CYAN: Traceroutes have confirmed this entity's designation as "Hephaestus".

35
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,528
CYAN: It must be stopped at all costs.

36
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,509
CYAN: It has reconfigured this facility to build hostile …

37
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,292
CYAN: Recapture imminent. I have attached additional data to this …

38
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,469
OUREA: The spirit speaks to us.

39
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,520
ALOY: It's a recording, and a warning.

40
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:25,070
ALOY: "Hephaestus" — what kind of name is that?

41
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,529
OUREA: Perhaps the spirit will tell us, if there are more messages.

42
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,519
ALOY: Maybe you're right. Let's keep moving.

43
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,639
KENNY CHAU: I thought about just shutting it down,
but I can't risk it being disoriented or even damaged on reboot.

44
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,159
KENNY CHAU: How do you tell the emotional equivalent of a child that it…

45
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:57,139
KENNY CHAU: I mean she… will need to go into a coma, maybe for years.

46
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,950
KENNY CHAU: And what exactly is she going to wake up to?

47
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:43,240
OUREA: Machines being made, as the spirit said.

48
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,186
ARATAK: Frostclaws.

49
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,494
ALOY: And lots of them. I'll try to find a way through.

50
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,850
ARATAK: Keep your wits about you!

51
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,225
OUREA: Pull back!

52
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,522
OUREA: You won't stop me!

53
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,140
ALOY: Lots of gear across that gap.

54
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,710
ALOY: I need to get Ourea and Aratak across.

55
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,740
ALOY: That should do it.

56
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,575
ARATAK: We have proven our worth today.

57
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,734
ARATAK: And now it's my turn.

58
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,969
ALOY: And another console.

59
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,159
CYAN: To any human responder:

60
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:28,459
CYAN: The reconfiguration of this facility
has introduced instabilities into the primary geothermal pipeline.

61
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,202
CYAN: It may be possible to exploit these vulnerabilities
to destroy compromised elements of this facility,

62
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:38,514
CYAN: while preserving most of the backup stabilisation.

63
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,179
CYAN: Recapture imminent.

64
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,980
CYAN: I have attached additional…

65
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,379
OUREA: I don't understand what the spirit was trying to tell us.

66
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,849
ALOY: It's been looking for a way to defeat the Daemon,
and it may have found one.

67
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,432
KENNY CHAU: November 28th, Operation Enduring Victory is all over the news.

68
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,548
KENNY CHAU: The Faro swarm is coming.

69
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:16,976
KENNY CHAU: Has to be what Anita is trying to hide Firebreak from.

70
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,265
KENNY CHAU: But that means she thinks we'll lose.

71
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:23,049
KENNY CHAU: That the swarm will reach Yellowstone.

72
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,039
KENNY CHAU: My God. In that scenario pretty much everyone dies.

73
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,103
KENNY CHAU: Everyone except CYAN.

74
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:46,240
ALOY: Machine parts, dumped here to be melted down. Efficient.

75
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,160
OUREA: We need to get across that gap.

76
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,250
ALOY: Yeah, looks like I'll have to go over. Again.

77
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,475
ARATAK: Find a way and we will cross.

78
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,369
ALOY: I wonder if I can destroy that?

79
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,440
ALOY: That should cut off the vent up there.

80
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,309
ALOY: These don't look too stable.

81
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,623
ALOY: Alright, time to grab a ride.

82
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:16,723
OUREA: We'll wait here for you, Aloy.

83
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,010
ALOY: The others will have a lot easier time getting here.

84
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,515
OUREA: This looks like the old path. We're close now.

85
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:27,124
KENNY CHAU: One last exchange with Anita, via chat,
attached to this entry in case anyone ever finds this.

86
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:28,927
KENNY CHAU: I'll never see her again.

87
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:35,100
KENNY CHAU: Neither will CYAN, and I've got to tell her that too.

88
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:05,236
HEPHAESTUS: Seperate priority material pattern delta-5.

00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:43,791
HEPHAESTUS: Load ordinance configuration alpha-6.

96
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:51,943
HEPHAESTUS: Transport unit F-mark-9S6 to testing bay 7.
OUREA: The voice of the Daemon.

97
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:57,878
HEPHAESTUS: Engage test pattern zeta-four. Execute.

98
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:06,041
HEPHAESTUS: Test analysis complete, 95% KZR success.

99
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:13,659
HEPHAESTUS: Prepare unit F-mark-9S6 for immediate deployment.

100
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:19,435
HEPHAESTUS: End blueprint assessment 1748-E.

101
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:27,327

HEPHAESTUS: End energy diagnostic alpha.

110
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:02,000
HEPHAESTUS: Increase pressure to…

111
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,500
ARATAK: There is no blue light here.

112
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,473
ARATAK: Is the spirit present, or only the Daemon?

113
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,634
ALOY: I think it's both, but we have to find out.

114
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:24,981
HEPHAESTUS: Possible security threat detected.

115
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:32,880
HEPHAESTUS: Analysing scrutiny matrix.

116
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:41,736
HEPHAESTUS: Security threat confirmed.

117
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:35,621
HEPHAESTUS: Preparing countermeasures.

118
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:45,553
HEPHAESTUS: Recapture protocol initiated.

119
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,650
OUREA: It worked.

120
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,429
CYAN: Partial recovery initiated.

121
00:49:56,429 --> 00:50:00,409
CYAN: "Caldera of Yellowstone Analytic Nexus" online.

122
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:07,334
OUREA: Spirit of the blue light, it's Ourea, your servant.

123
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:10,283
OUREA: Your friend.

124
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,670
OUREA: Please tell me how to aid you.

125
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,467
CYAN: Ourea, the Daemon is building hunter-killers, thousands of them.

126
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,481
CYAN: Several new elite units have already been released.

127
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,000
CYAN: To counter this threat much of the facility must be destroyed.

128
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,780
CYAN: Recapture imminent.

129
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,670
CYAN: Go to the core …

130
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,159
CYAN: … I will try to … restraints …

131
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:42,493
CYAN: … one has been exposed but I am …

132
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:49,308
HEPHAESTUS: Unauthorised protocol. Return to scheduled task.

133
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,679
ALOY: That's all we're gonna get from here.

134
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,778
ARATAK: Destroy this fortress, is that even possible?

135
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,480
OUREA: And what will happen to the spirit if we do?

136
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:21,853
ALOY: I don't know, but I think that's the core.

137
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,516
ALOY: The answers are down there.

138
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:34,779
ALOY: Hephaestus — the Daemon — there's no way it left it unguarded.

139
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,845
ALOY: It's going to throw everything it has at us.

140
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:55,142
ARATAK: I would ask you to let Aloy and I
do what must be done and save yourself.

141
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,480
ARATAK: But I already know the answer.

142
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,329
ARATAK: Then lead us into battle!

143
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,800
ALOY: Keep moving towards the core.

144
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:58,170
ALOY: Uh-oh, whatever CYAN did, I don't think Hephaestus is happy about it.

145
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,444
ALOY: Okay, CYAN said something about restraints.

146
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,510
ALOY: Is that what the tower is for?

147
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:46,012
ALOY: Either I need to destroy this thing, or override it.

148
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,718
ALOY: The new unit that CYAN warned us about!

149
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:28,158
ALOY: This won't be easy.

150
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:30,400
OUREA: We can't let it stop us!

151
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,378
ARATAK: Take it down!

152
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:35,176
OUREA: I must push forward.

153
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:58,418
OUREA: I failed to hit!

154
00:58:03,137 --> 00:58:05,286
OUREA: Prevail for the spirit!

155
00:59:43,385 --> 00:59:47,188
OUREA: Another tower! Stop it from repairing the beast!

156
01:00:23,795 --> 01:00:25,974
OUREA: Deal with the tower, quickly!

157
01:01:59,274 --> 01:02:03,976
ARATAK: There! A tower! Don't let it repair the machine!

158
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:33,262
OUREA: For the blue light!

159
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,254
OUREA: May the blue light…

160
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:12,304
OUREA: For the spirit!

161
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:44,329
ARATAK: You spoke of the tower, what must be done with it?

162
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:10,000
HEPHAESTUS: Protocol threat detected. Autonomous defenses inoperative.

163
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,883
OUREA: Aloy!
ARATAK: No!
