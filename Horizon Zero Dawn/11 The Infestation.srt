1
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,980
No passage west, and no exceptions!

2
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,878
So long as corrupted machines prowl the valley.

3
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,410
Then why don't you do something about the infestation?

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,619
We have! We sealed the border!

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,899
Fine.

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,899
I'll come back once I've destroyed all the corrupted.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,119
[laughs]

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,820
Huh? If you're serious, then may you go in light girl
and the Sun guide your arrows.

9
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
I wonder what's down here.

10
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,227
This isn't a cave. It's a ruin.

11
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,443
Such strange artifacts.

12
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,409
Armour. From the age of the Old Ones.

13
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,799
But how do I get to it?

14
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,529
Red light.

15
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,700
I'm not getting in.

16
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,700
I think the Old Ones used numbers like this to indicate time.

17
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,649
These devices are missing power cells.

18
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,639
I'll have to find power cells to get these to work.

19
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,399
Keep quiet, now.

20
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,919
And go!

21
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,639
Are you all right, Hunter?

22
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,009
I'm not a Hunter, or a Brave, or anything, really.

23
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,800
You shouldn't even be talking to me.

24
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,039
Well, whoever you are, you're hurt.

25
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,240
What happened?

26
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
My name's Cren.

27
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:04,860
I thought I'd have a go at the trials
of the Hunting Grounds over the rise.

28
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,044
You know, hone my skills.

29
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:08,849
It, uh…

30
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:10,400
It didn't go very well.

31
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,532
I was aiming for a canister on the back of a Grazer
and my bowstring snapped and I tripped and…

32
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,000
Things aren't exactly going your way, are they?

33
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,534
Is there anything I can do to help?

34
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,009
No, no.

35
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,909
I stole a bow, okay.

36
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,718
And got cast out. This was before the Proving.

37
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,358
So now I can't even fight for my tribe in its time of need.

38
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,009
I have to live in the wild by myself.

39
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,909
Which is why I wanted some training.

40
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,919
Honestly, I'm just glad the Keeper would talk to me.

41
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,759
I think he might be an exile or something.

42
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,467
I need to get going, Cren.

43
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,646
All right, be careful, especially if you're heading north.

44
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:50,583
And be sure to hit the Hunting Grounds if you want to train up.

45
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,307
The Keeper's up there on the hill just to the north.

46
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,919
Talk to him to do a trial.

47
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,459
I'm sure you'll do better than I did.

48
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:42,609
Here we go again.

49
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,609
It felt that!

50
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,489
Found a Vantage.

51
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,240
Need to piece the messages together.

52
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,920
Apocashitstorm Tour, day two.

53
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,119
My father guest lectured here.

54
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,715
A 300-level military history course on the age of human air power.

55
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:18,119
Might as well have been teaching medieval siege tactics.

56
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,299
I was eight when he died.

57
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,595
Let's see you catch us.

58
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:57,740
I spoke to Cren.

59
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,109
He told me this is a Hunting Grounds where you offer tests of skill.

60
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,529
Poor Cren.

61
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:06,619
Not the best Hunter, but at least he keeps his chin up.

62
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,598
Hmm, you bear the mark of a Seeker.

63
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,539
I've heard of those, but never seen one.

64
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,534
You have the Matriarchs leave to come and go as you like from the Sacred Land?

65
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,539
Yes, but I would have gone even without their permission.

66
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,739
Is that so?

67
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,339
Then maybe you and I can speak plainly.

68
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:29,240
Truth is I've had dealings with the Carja.

69
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,200
You're not supposed to be here, are you?

70
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,769
No, my friend and I left the Sacred Land and returned.

71
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,619
We're hunters at heart.

72
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,009
Left because we wanted to find new herds and new machines.

73
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,029
The Matriarchs wouldn't approve, to say the least.

74
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,296
I represent an organization called the Hunter's Lodge.

75
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:54,099
Hunters who compete to bring down the mightiest machines
in the land, run by the Carja in Meridian.

76
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,528
We test promising young hunters with trials in places like these.

77
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,819
Each offering hunters a chance to test their skills.

78
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,420
You might be just the kind of person we're looking for.

79
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,319
What do I get for completing them?

80
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,220
Pride in accomplishment as well as Marks, depending on how well you fare.

81
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,420
Hunting isn't just about your bow.

82
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,519
It's about using everything available to you, even your surroundings.

83
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,619
You'll see once you start taking the trials.

84
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,763
Just to be clear, though,
I'd appreciate it if you kept our conversation in confidence.

85
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,269
Especially when it comes to the Matriarchs.

86
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,519
You think it'll work staying here without the Matriarchs permission?

87
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,910
I'm not sure, but we don't believe in their rules.

88
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,210
There's a big world out there and ignoring it doesn't help anyone.

89
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,410
Test your skill with bow and arrow by shooting parts
off the backs of Grazers as quickly as possible.

90
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,339
I'll start timing when you slide down one of the ropes.

91
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,109
Makes this a little easier.

92
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,619
Stocking up.

93
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,819
How'd you…?

94
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,920
First time and you win a Blazing Sun!

95
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,019
You're good, even for Nora.

96
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,787
This trial tests your ability to use the environment to your advantage.

97
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:32,068
Shoot log piles to make them fall, crushing machines below.

98
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:34,210
I'll start timing when you start down the rope.

99
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,200
They're scanning for me.

100
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,029
How'd you…?

101
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,119
First time and you win a Blazing Sun!

102
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,200
You're good, even for Nora.

103
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,973
This trial requires you to bring Grazers down with Blast wires.

104
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:08,420
But you'll need the Carja Tripcaster and ammunition to do it.

105
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,910
My friend here may have them for sale.

106
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,009
Can't wait to see what you do with that.

107
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,348
Use your Blast wire and Carja Tripcaster to bring down Grazers.

108
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:45,529
I'll be timing you.

109
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,009
All right.

110
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,429
How'd you…?

111
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,500
First time and you win a Blazing Sun!

112
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,719
You're good, even for Nora.

113
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,610
You have everything you need to enter the Hunter's Lodge.

114
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
Good luck in Meridian.

115
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:24,934
Of course, you can still run more trials with me.

116
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,067
I should go.

117
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:28,147
Come back when you're ready.

118
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,458
I have three Suns.

119
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,099
Now they'll let me inside the Hunter's Lodge.

120
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,909
Well, let's see how that turns out.

121
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:55,124
Saving these for the trail.

122
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,409
They've seen me.

123
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,500
That man, he doesn't look Nora.

124
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:43,329
Varl spoke of a bandit camp in some metal ruins.

125
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,289
That must be the place there.

126
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,489
Best keep an eye out around here.

127
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,300
Stay low, girl, or you'll spoil the fun.

128
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,360
There is danger ahead.

129
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,179
More danger than you know, outlander.

130
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,500
You're trespassing… 

131
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,257
On Nora land. It's forbidden. My life is forfeit.

132
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,077
Yes, yes, yes, are we done?

133
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,607
Call me Nil.

134
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:20,413
Look there. Those old rocks?

135
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,534
A bandit clan squats under them.

136
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:24,956
Disturb the rocks and they'lll come wriggling out.

137
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:27,114
Worms that they are.

138
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:29,760
Bandits. Why have they come here?

139
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,780
The Nora are in trouble.

140
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,782
Rumours spread like blood.

141
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:38,258
With no braves to guard the border,
killers hungry for sport slip right through.

142
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:41,400
My partner and I shadowed these scum for days.

143
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,457
Good tracker, but he went on ahead without me.

144
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,489
We'd talked about this kind of behaviour.

145
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,570
Still, I understand.

146
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,757
Leave it too long, your fingers itch for the bowstring.

147
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,259
Say, How about you and I work together?

148
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,670
Kill them all?

149
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,667
I don't need your help to clear out some bandits.

150
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,980
A loner. That's exciting.

151
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,059
Don't worry.

152
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,100
If they kill you, I'll finish them off,

153
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,200
before they could make a cup of your skull
or any other nonsense like that.

154
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,360
I don't know you and I have no reason to trust you.

155
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:17,260
Trust is a rare egg to find, isn't it?

156
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:23,170
I'm just a traveler with a bow, a concern about the state of these lands…

157
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,267
And a missing partner.

158
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,834
I don't think you're "just" anything at all.

159
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,380
Hmm, let me put it another way.

160
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,380
Are you a bandit?

161
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,780
Of course not!

162
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,480
Then you have nothing to fear from me.

163
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,698
Change your mind?

164
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:49,249
No, just checking you weren't lining up a shot on my back.

165
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,869
You have my word.

166
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,579
Never from the back.

167
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:06,360
Okay.

168
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,085
That alarm will wake up the whole camp.

169
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:50,217
And more besides.

170
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,369
Okay, alarm's down.

171
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:54,760
[Bandit]
Heard something.

172
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:10,239
[Bandit]
Fire, right near my damn face!

173
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:35,849
[Bandit]
She's coming for us!

174
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,048
[Bandit]
I'll finish you!

175
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,048
[Bandit]
Get it together, lump!

176
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,179
[Bandit]
You won't survive this.

177
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,909
They must be the bandits' prisoners.

178
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,248
[Bandit]
Wouldn't want to be you, fool.

179
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,440
I'm gonna get you out.

180
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:47,239
You're coming with me.

181
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,460
[Bandit]
Search is off.

182
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:21,579
I gotta pick it up and move!

183
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:37,340
[Bandit]
Can't see him!

184
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,239
[Bandit]
Here we are.

185
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,139
Seeker, may I speak with you?

186
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,161
I'm honoured, I…

187
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:33,449
All-Mother be praised!

188
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,820
Are you all right?

189
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,230
Is there something you need?

190
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,300
Yes.

191
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,320
My friends and I watched you clear the bandits out of this camp.

192
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:42,739
We're glad.

193
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,659
They would steal from us.

194
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:47,949
Chase us through the night, laughing.

195
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,539
We're outcasts, not Braves.

196
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,429
Almost defenseless.

197
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,429
Where did you all come from?

198
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,030
Some of us have wandered the Sacred Lands for years.

199
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,250
As for me, the village I grew up in was burned in the Red Raids.

200
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,760
I'm ashamed I wasn't there to protect them.

201
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,130
But I was an outcast long before the Carja came.

202
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,650
How did you all come to be here together?

203
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:18,019
You wonder how we speak to each other when the law forbids it?

204
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,030
But what hope do we have here, outside the Embrace, alone?

205
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,929
I wasn't judging you.

206
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,269
I was an outcast once.

207
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,130
Forgive me.

208
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,019
You're right to ask.

209
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,630
I convinced them to speak.

210
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,730
I told them we were only sentenced to be outcast, not to die out here.

211
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,530
An intelligent approach.

212
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,150
I was a fool.

213
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,519
I refused to do what I was told.

214
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:49,434
Never went hunting when I could sit under a tree instead.

215
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:53,829
I argued with my family every step. Picked fights with other Braves.

216
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,360
One day such a fight grew fierce.

217
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,030
I got a lucky hit.

218
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,739
An unlucky one.

219
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:05,329
He went down and there was no one left to speak for me.

220
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,449
I deserve to be an outcast.

221
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,500
You seem different from the person you describe.

222
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,176
I hope to be. We are all outcasts.

223
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:18,300
But we need to stay together to survive.

224
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,400
This camp we once hated could serve us well now.

225
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,730
Would you let us stay here, even if it flies in the face of the Matriarchs laws?

226
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,768
Of course, by all means.

227
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:30,710
Oh!

228
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,630
I'd hoped you'd say so.

229
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:36,948
You… you're an inspiration to us.

230
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,119
Thank you.

231
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,530
Thank you for making this possible.

232
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,038
I'll admit at first I felt slighted by your selfishness.

233
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:43,093
But, you know, I'm glad I stayed to watch.

234
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:48,673
Every kill you made, I'd prick my fingers
on an arrowhead just to … to feel part of things.

235
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:50,519
You were keeping score?

236
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,139
What's wrong with you?

237
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:54,750
I saw you were preoccupied.

238
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,467
I didn't find your partner.

239
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,329
They killed him.

240
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:59,148
I hardly feel surprised.

241
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,099
He was already getting cocky when we carved through the last bandit camp.

242
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,797
I thought he and I were agreed.

243
00:54:04,797 --> 00:54:07,099
Only enjoy the killing as much as the challenge.

244
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,210
No great loss.

245
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,918
Nothing in the wilds I can't handle,
just me and "The Voice of Our Teeth" here.

246
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,300
Your bow has a name?

247
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,734
Yours doesn't?

248
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,426
You're not just a traveler.

249
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:23,119
That armour was fitted for you, and the way you hold your bow…

250
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:26,420
I said a concerned traveler.

251
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:31,298
I was a soldier, but I was a soldier longer than there was a war if you follow.

252
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:35,109
Where the arrowhead passes between armour and skin?

253
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:37,139
That's the place I belong.

254
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:39,500
So I make opportunities to find it.

255
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,058
It's like coming home.

256
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,929
Have you ever thought about hunting machines?

257
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,639
Nah, they don't get that look in their eyes.

258
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:50,634
Did bandits wrong you, somehow?

259
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,610
They wrong us all. They live filthy lives.

260
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,710
So they have to die that way too.

261
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,610
So you hunt them down to help others?

262
00:54:58,739 --> 00:54:59,619
No, no.

263
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,019
For sport.

264
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,639
I can't wait for wars any more.

265
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,407
Life's too short and the thrill of death too sharp.

266
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,398
If you kill a tribesmen, there'll be retribution.

267
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:11,920
Hunt a boar, they complain if you waste the meat.

268
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,118
But bandits, they're vicious.

269
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,898
They always put up a fight.

270
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,809
And no-one cares if you kill them.

271
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,710
I guess you're doing the right thing for the wrong reason.

272
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:24,409
I'm doing what I love.

273
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,334
And what could be wrong with that?

274
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:28,110
We're done here.

275
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:29,210
Here?

276
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:33,198
I'm afraid so, but we live in a world of ruins.

277
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,664
And bandits are drawn to them like infection to a wound.

278
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,000
You wouldn't let that infection set in, would you?

279
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,764
I'm sure we'll meet again.

280
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:45,229
Maybe. If it can't be helped.

281
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:49,267
If we pass each other by, we'll know it by our work.

282
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,239
That one will come up.

283
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,090
Snow.

284
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,190
Winter's on its way.

285
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:26,011
[Nora Brave]
This is for the Nora!

286
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:43,869
[Bandit]
Can't hit anything…

287
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:22,559
Won't waste this.

288
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,679
Keep quiet now.

289
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,500
[Bandit]
Death's coming for you, quick.

290
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:03,145
[whistle]

291
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,659
Rost will live on in All-Mothers memory, Seeker.

292
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,440
And in mine.

293
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:38,529
The forsaken village that Marea spoke of, in shambles.

294
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,439
They're scanning for me.

295
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,318
Here they come!

296
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:04,859
Corrupted Watchers.

297
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:04,130
That's it…

298
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,340
I've done what I can to cleanse this valley of corruption.

299
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:32,170
Time to see if the Carja fort will let me pass over the mountains.
