1
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:29,050
ALOY: Somehow Elisabet stopped war machines from destroying the world.

2
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:35,834
ALOY: She couldn't save the civilisation of the Old Ones, that was destroyed obviously.

3
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:40,049
But life, it survived.

4
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,304
She saved life from being devoured.

5
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,189
I need to know how Elisabet stopped the machines.

6
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,267
If I can find the weapon she built and use it, the Eclipse won't stand a chance.

7
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:03,780
I went into the Grave-Hoard. It lived up to its name.

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,913
Millions of people fought and died to give Elisabet
the time she needed to finish Zero Dawn.

9
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,747
The weapon she built it wasn't there, but I found out where she built it.

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,849
A secret base west of here.

11
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,842
Right under Sunfall, the capital of the Shadow Carja.

12
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,638
I see you've been here before.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,140
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: Obviously.

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,349
SYLENS: I've spent a lifetime trying to uncover the secrets of this world.

15
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,260
ALOY: I'm heading down.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,969
SYLENS: A lifetime of failure.

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,316
SYLENS: I hit walls I could not break, doors I could never breach.

18
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,693
SYLENS: Until a Nora huntress marched out of the savage east.

19
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:04,300
SYLENS: For her all the deepest secrets of the earth were laid bare.

20
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,810
ALOY: Hello.

21
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,930
SYLENS: I suspect you will have an easier time
with this door than I did years ago.

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,689
COMPUTER: Hold for Identiscan.

23
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,325
COMPUTER: Genetic profile confirmed. Entry authorised.

24
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,508
COMPUTER: Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction.

25
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:36,429
ALOY: Are you kidding me!

26
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,208
SYLENS: You don't hear me laughing.

27
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,238
ALOY: Shut up! There's got to be another way.

28
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,400
Hey! Elisabet Sobeck here, requesting access!

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,545
COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. Command functions available.

30
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,073
COMPUTER: Do you wish to proceed?

31
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,039
ALOY: I do, get me through this door!

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,459
COMPUTER: Analysing. Primary access inoperable due to mechanical failure.

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,989
COMPUTER: Emergency venting procedure likely to circumvent blockage.

34
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,750
COMPUTER: Do you wish to proceed?

35
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,659
Yes.

36
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,727
COMPUTER: Emergency venting authorised.

37
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:20,282
SYLENS: I underestimated you. You'd think by now, I—

38
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:28,911
ALOY: Guess you can't have everything.

39
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,330
SYLENS: That will draw attention.

40
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,869
SYLENS: We won't have this place to ourselves for long now.

41
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:36,038
ALOY: "We"? Last I checked, I was the one risking my life down here.

42
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,750
SYLENS: Yes, fine. Now will you please get moving?

43
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,550
SYLENS: There's so much to learn and less time than I'd hoped.

44
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,604
COMPUTER: Welcome to Project Zero Dawn.

45
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:51,434
ALOY: Zero Dawn, we found it!

46
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,349
SYLENS: Are you really so surprised?

47
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,340
COMPUTER: Facility diagnostics detect multiple failures. Attempting repair.

48
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,968
ALOY: So what was this room?

49
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,677
SYLENS: An Entrance hall perhaps. Have a look around.

50
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,949
COMPUTER: Please take a seat and wait for your name to be called.

51
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,618
COMPUTER: A selection of beverages and snacks are available.

52
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,470
ALOY: A smaller room.

53
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,269
COMPUTER: Please proceed into Viewing Room 1
for an important message regarding the purpose of your visit.

54
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,759
ALOY: What… what was this place?

55
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,769
SYLENS: A holographic theatre.

56
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,267
COMPUTER: ZD01 data intact. Initiating playback.

57
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,210
Welcome to Project Zero Dawn.

58
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:40,528
I am General Herres, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America.

59
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,404
I'm sure you've heard the rumours.

60
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:45,870
That Zero Dawn is a top secret superweapons programme.

61
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,928
The technological miracle that will save us from the Faro plague.

62
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,553
If Operation Enduring Victory can hold off the robots long enough.

63
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:58,960
The reason that I'm sure you've heard the rumours
is that I'm the one who spread them.

64
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,769
And they are all lies.

65
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,850
Zero Dawn is not a superweapons programme and it will not save us.

66
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,090
Nothing will save us.

67
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,419
And here's why.

68
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,750
By the time the glitch was noticed, it was already too late.

69
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,000
Nothing could stop the Faro plague. Nothing can.

70
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,450
Its robots will continue to replicate and devour the biosphere.

71
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,480
Life on Earth will be destroyed.

72
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,779
Our planet reduced to a barren sphere.

73
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,549
Global extinction is inevitable.

74
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:41,259
No matter how many we kill, the robots just keep exponentially making more.

75
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,200
If we had their deactivation codes
we could shut them all down, the entire swarm.

76
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:56,597
But since their cryptographic protocols used polyphasic
entangled waveforms, cracking a codeset would take half a century.

77
00:10:56,597 --> 00:11:00,009
At best we've got sixteen months.

78
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,190
Not exactly what you'd call a survival option.

79
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:09,079
The destruction of a biosphere is not the sort of apocalypse
you can wait out in a fallout shelter or space station.

80
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,422
There will be no Earth left to reclaim.

81
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:16,134
Just a lifeless toxic rock with several million Faro robots on it.

82
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,000
Hibernating, waiting for something to eat.

83
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,460
This is the horrible truth behind the lies of Operation Enduring Victory.

84
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,750
My lies, lies designed to inspire
millions of innocents to sacrifice themselves in battle.

85
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,182
Why? One reason.

86
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,630
To buy time for you and the work you will do here.

87
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:49,049
Zero Day, the day that life on Earth ceases to exist, is coming fast.

88
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,159
It cannot be stopped.

89
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,750
The hope of Zero Dawn is that something new might come after.

90
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,114
But I will leave it to Elisabet Sobeck
to shine that thin ray of light into the darkness.

91
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,809
Herres out.

92
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,809
ALOY: That doesn't make sense.

93
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,590
ALOY: Life on Earth didn't cease to exist.

94
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,120
SYLENS: He said it could not be stopped.

95
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,240
ALOY: But it was! Somehow… somehow Elisabet saved us.

96
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,983
ALOY: I've got to keep looking. Find out how she did it.

97
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,929
ALOY: Kestrels. They got in, through the vents.

98
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,619
SYLENS: Let nothing stop you from learning the truth.

99
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,910
ECLIPSE: Spread out! If it moves kill it!

100
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,267
ECLIPSE: What is this place? A tomb?

101
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,490
ALOY: Spotted!

102
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,113
SYLENS: We're too close to let tribal primitives stop us now.

103
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,267
SYLENS: The datapoints, what do they contain?

104
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:12,679
COUNSELOR: —ing with Susanne Alpert, environmental scientist. Doctor?

105
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,766
SUSANNE ALPERT: I'm sorry? I wasn't, er…

106
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:19,240
COUNSELOR: Just stating your name. What were you thinking about, doctor?

107
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,759
SUSANNE ALPERT: Nothing the general said, not really.

108
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:29,679
SUSANNE ALPERT: I was on the Syzygy East Response Team in 2051,
just after the second earthquake compromised the reactor.

109
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,870
SUSANNE ALPERT: I still dream about it after all these years.

110
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:40,139
SUSANNE ALPERT: The red zone spreading on the imaging
slowly, so slowly, like a hand opening its fingers.

111
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,329
COUNSELOR: Your involvement in that event is why you were asked for by name.

112
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,769
SUSANNE ALPERT: Really? That's interesting because nothing worked.

113
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,119
SUSANNE ALPERT: Nothing could grow there again.

114
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,442
SUSANNE ALPERT: It was a catastrophic failure.

115
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:56,649
SUSANNE ALPERT: But the red zone is a blip
compared to global scale biomass reduction.

116
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,733
SUSANNE ALPERT: The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse,
render the Earth uninhabitable long before the robots finish us.

117
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,840
SUSANNE ALPERT: Enduring Victory can't buy time against that.

118
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:11,259
SUSANNE ALPERT: So you'd better show me what Zero Dawn really is.

119
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,485
COUNSELOR: I'm sure you now understand
the urgency of why we brought you here Ms Okilo?

120
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:57,210
CPT. OKILO: Captain Okilo. Are you trying to thank me for not resisting?

121
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,231
COUNSELOR: I believe we couldn't negotiate a diplomatic solution.

122
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:07,335
CPT. OKILO: When it came to my country's lithium
it was always a swarm that would be sent to negotiate.

123
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:13,402
CPT. OKILO: Metallurgic International, US Robot Command,
the markings changed, but the robots were the same.

124
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,950
COUNSELOR: You have had considerable experience in human-robot conflict.

125
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,859
CPT. OKILO: Yes, and I've got the prosthetic limbs to show it.

126
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:27,012
CPT. OKILO: Yet I continue
to face this horror even though the challenge was great.

127
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:35,293
CPT. OKILO: Cyber warfare. I thought Zero Dawn
would be a–a Manhattan Project to generate the deactivation codes.

128
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:40,338
CPT. OKILO: With the resources I had
I estimated codebreaking to be a hopeless endeavour.

129
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,538
CPT. OKILO: I was almost looking forward to being proved wrong.

130
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,881
COUNSELOR: Unfortunately, your estimation was correct.

131
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,720
CPT. OKILO: As your General Herres said.

132
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,501
CPT. OKILO: So then. You didn't bring me here to commiserate, what is left?

133
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,818
RON FELDER: Look, let's cut the mystery.

134
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,629
RON FELDER: You're building a colony ship, it's obvious.

135
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,400
RON FELDER: And it's not gonna fly. I mean, literally.

136
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,639
RON FELDER: Remember the Odyssey, that multinational
heap of space junk that's been in graveyard orbit since '57?

137
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,549
RON FELDER: That went nowhere real slow,
and you have to get somewhere real fast.

138
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:26,139
RON FELDER: Do you have any idea
the immensity of the challenge to prep a new colony ship in time?

139
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,338
COUNSELOR: To be clear, I'm not a worker on the project.

140
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,558
RON FELDER: Do you even understand how few people it could save?

141
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,929
RON FELDER: The whole generation ship concept is… is not gonna happen.

142
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,000
RON FELDER: It's the first thing you'd abandon in favour of embryonics.

143
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,339
RON FELDER: For that kind of storage we're talking
a lot of bulk, a lot of power, a lot of resources.

144
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:53,269
RON FELDER: So even if you do it, even if you build it
and point it at Sirius X, there's no room for people on that thing, alright?

145
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,688
COUNSELOR: If you could try to remain calm…

146
00:18:55,688 --> 00:19:00,390
RON FELDER: You people are crazy if you think
you're getting off this rock, no-one's getting off!

147
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,580
COUNSELOR: Medical!

148
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,348
DR. HSU-VHEY: There is some mistake.

149
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,308
DR. HSU-VHEY: I don't understand why I was brought here.

150
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,879
DR. HSU-VHEY: Why would you show me these things?

151
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,495
COUNSELOR: I know that there's already a lot to take in.

152
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:23,446
DR. HSU-VHEY: In the waiting area I was seated with
a Nobel laureate in biophysics and a monk, I think.

153
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:25,849
DR. HSU-VHEY: He spoke neither English nor Mandarin.

154
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,139
DR. HSU-VHEY: It is very strange.

155
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,278
DR. HSU-VHEY: And General Herres, what was he talking about?

156
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,598
DR. HSU-VHEY: The robot swarm, the Faro plague?

157
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,237
DR. HSU-VHEY: I understand it is terrible, but it really cannot be stopped?

158
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:40,059
DR. HSU-VHEY: Why tell us this?

159
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,869
DR. HSU-VHEY: There are people in Shanghai, my friends, my family.

160
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:47,538
DR. HSU-VHEY: They have joined Operation Enduring Victory already.

161
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:50,839
DR. HSU-VHEY: It is for nothing? We will all die?

162
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,880
COUNSELOR: We're going to be able to answer some of these questions.

163
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,249
DR. HSU-VHEY: I just want to know why I am here.

164
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,150
DR. HSU-VHEY: It doesn't make sense to me.

165
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,838
COUNSELOR: You were brought here because of your skill set.

166
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,828
DR. HSU-VHEY: No, that can't be right.

167
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,949
DR. HSU-VHEY: I am an art historian.

168
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,555
DR. HSU-VHEY: I know Dutch masters, Japanese calligraphy, Gerhard Richter.

169
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,660
DR. HSU-VHEY: What does that matter now?

170
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,750
COUNSELOR: —that is accurate, yes.

171
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,339
TOM PAECH: So these mechanical monstrosities
they don't just kill people, they feed off them?

172
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,460
COUNSELOR: Not just people, all organic matter.

173
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,009
TOM PAECH: Every living thing dissolved into nutrients.

174
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,839
TOM PAECH: Millennia of evolution liquefied.

175
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,710
TOM PAECH: The miracle of life reduced to bloody biofuel?!

176
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,276
COUNSELOR: In a word, yes.

177
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:50,811
TOM PAECH: Who did this? Faro? That arsehole, is he here?

178
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,156
COUNSELOR: No, Doctor, please…

179
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:55,620
TOM PAECH: Tell him Tom Paech wants a word!

180
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,787
[sounds of struggling]

181
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,498
TOM PAECH: Nah, get off, get off!

182
00:20:58,499 --> 00:20:59,816
[sounds of struggling]

183
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:02,099
COUNSELOR: Doc, please!

184
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,172
TOM PAECH: You get Ted Faro in here!

185
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,856
COUNSELOR: —want to discuss?

186
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:15,359
TRAVIS TATE: Whoof. So Mama, she was right.

187
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,759
COUNSELOR: Pardon?

188
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,568
TRAVIS TATE: My mother. She took her Bible real serious.

189
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:23,770
TRAVIS TATE: Not just Texas Bubble serious, Pentecostal serious.

190
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,285
TRAVIS TATE: Favourite chapter? Revelations.

191
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:31,463
TRAVIS TATE: Now, I didn't always understand her
on account of all that speaking in tongues and such, but…

192
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:39,250
TRAVIS TATE: When she did use her words, it was always 
"end times" this and "the lake of fire" that on account of sinful lifestyles.

193
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:43,153
TRAVIS TATE: Speaking of which, mind if I smoke?

194
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:45,279
COUNSELOR: A tobacco cigarette?

195
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,728
TRAVIS TATE: Sorry, darlin'. My tastes run classic.

196
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:50,992
TRAVIS TATE: Compliments to your team tracked me down.

197
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:53,205
TRAVIS TATE: Been a price on my head eighteen months now.

198
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,923
TRAVIS TATE: Sterling-Malkeet was me, don't mind admitting.

199
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:59,970
TRAVIS TATE: Been plenty of snakesters chasing the bounty too.

200
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:03,440
TRAVIS TATE: But I kept the zigging to their zag.

201
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,439
TRAVIS TATE: How'd you finger me?

202
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,849
COUNSELOR: I believe Dr Sobeck listed you as an Alpha candidate.

203
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,019
COUNSELOR: Priority snatch and grab.

204
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,038
TRAVIS TATE: Always suspected she had a little thing for me.

205
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,269
TRAVIS TATE: Hey, I don't suppose you got real coffee in this place?

206
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,538
TRAVIS TATE: You know, blood coffee? Conflict cappuccinos?

207
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:31,048
COUNSELOR: Mr. Tate, I'm clearing you to proceed. Just … go.

208
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,209
COUNSELOR: You previously worked for Faro Automated Systems.

209
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:43,099
BRAD ANDAC: On the Chariot line self-replication routines.

210
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:47,009
BRAD ANDAC: I–I came here thinking this was a–a rendition?

211
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,099
BRAD ANDAC: When your people took me, I thought "about time".

212
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,829
BRAD ANDAC: I've been trying to swallow the guilt every day since…

213
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,016
BRAD ANDAC: …since, uh…

214
00:22:58,016 --> 00:22:59,939
COUNSELOR: Would you like to take a moment?

215
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,841
BRAD ANDAC: No, no, no, I just…

216
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,983
BRAD ANDAC: I really hoped Zero Dawn was a way to undo it all.

217
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:08,038
BRAD ANDAC: My work.

218
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,788
BRAD ANDAC: I'm sorry to say I was ever proud of it,
but Ted could really sell a concept.

219
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:19,950
BRAD ANDAC: And–and–and in the labs,
in the light of creation, that first test run.

220
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:27,529
BRAD ANDAC: When–when you saw they understood their own structures,
could rebuild themselves from memory and light?

221
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,349
BRAD ANDAC: There were no limits!

222
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,759
BRAD ANDAC: God, there were no limits.

223
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,083
COMPUTER: ZD02 data intact. Initiating playback.

224
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,440
Elisabet Sobeck.

225
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,259
You've heard the bad news and it's all true.

226
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,469
The Faro plague is devouring the biosphere.

227
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,500
Life itself will cease to exist.

228
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,053
But does that have to be the end?

229
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,759
What if we could give life a future?

230
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:21,500
What if we could build a kind of seed
from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew?

231
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,049
This is the aim, the hope, of Project Zero Dawn.

232
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,240
To create a super-intelligent, fully automated
terraforming system and bring life back from lifelessness.

233
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,599
What would such a system require?

234
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:46,517
At its core it would need a true AI fully capable of making
the trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere.

235
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:50,234
An immortal guardian devoted to the reflourishing of life.

236
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,019
We call it GAIA.

237
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,029
Mother Nature as an AI.

238
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,160
But that's just the core of the system.

239
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:06,068
She will need to be surrounded and empowered
by a comprehensive suite of subordinate functions.

240
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:09,070
Think of them as extensions of GAIA's mind.

241
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,180
Each dedicated to a specific purpose.

242
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,098
Now these aren't AIs, but make no mistake.

243
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:24,118
Each presents an engineering challenge more profound
than anything the human species has ever before attempted.

244
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:30,534
Hardware that preserves and then gestates
the billions of seeds and embryos from which life will be reborn.

245
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,140
The construction of underground facilities to hold it all.

246
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,318
And that's just the start.

247
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:39,849
We don't have to build the entire system.

248
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,849
The beauty of a fully automated terraforming system is that it can build itself.

249
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:52,589
Now over the days to come, you'll learn how all these functions,
all these pieces that you'll be working on fit together.

250
00:25:53,359 --> 00:26:00,000
How we'll race the clock to execute our harvest initiatives,
write the software, build the tech, and the facilities.

251
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,890
How we'll lock it down and seal it up before the inevitable occurs.

252
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,160
But even more important, you'll know how it doesn't end here.

253
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:13,858
How GAIA will generate those deactivation codes General Herres talked about.

254
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:19,539
And build the transmission arrays to broadcast them,
shutting down the Faro robots for good.

255
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:28,049
How GAIA will not just build but imagine
any conceivable robot it needs to do its work across centuries.

256
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,980
From detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere and poisoned seas.

257
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,449
To the regreening of the Earth from cryopreserved seed stocks.

258
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:40,199
To rewilding the Earth with animal life.

259
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:50,879
And then, when all that is done, how a new generation of human beings
spawned at cradle facilities around the globe will partake of Apollo.

260
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:58,450
The vast archive of human knowledge and cultural achievement
from which they will learn of us, our world.

261
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:04,049
And most important, how not to repeat our mistakes.

262
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,259
It's not an impossible dream.

263
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,316
It is within our grasp if we worked tirelessly and stop at nothing to achieve it.

264
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,960
We can't stop life from ending.

265
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,465
But if you will help me, help GAIA, we can give it a future.

266
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,759
Join me and help make that future real.

267
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,000
ALOY: The whole Earth destroyed, but then remade?

268
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:45,624
SYLENS: Yes, by a machine. A machine of creation.

269
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,936
ALOY: Elisabet did this for life, for us.

270
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:54,259
ALOY: But why Hades then?

271
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,990
ALOY: If it was part of GAIA, how'd it end up in the wreckage of a Faro robot?

272
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,388
ALOY: And why does it want to kill me?

273
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,079
ALOY: And Apollo, the archive of knowledge, what happened to that?

274
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,640
SYLENS: And Hephaestus taking over CYAN.

275
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,549
SYLENS: I'm as confused as you are.

276
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:14,049
SYLENS: Maybe the answers lie ahead.

277
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,160
BRAD ANDAC: Of course I'll do it.

278
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,779
BRAD ANDAC: To be given the opportunity to rebuild what I, uh, d-d-damaged?

279
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:05,910
BRAD ANDAC: Well, I-I don't feel worthy of it, but I will do it absolutely.

280
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,509
COUNSELLOR: I want to stress that this was never about your culpability.

281
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,626
BRAD ANDAC: Uh, i-i-it is to me.

282
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:15,500
BRAD ANDAC: Doctor Sobeck, Margo,
they were smart to get out of Faro when they did.

283
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,239
BRAD ANDAC: But-but not one of us took it as a warning sign.

284
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,210
BRAD ANDAC: We just told ourselves they weren't cut out for the BTRI cabals.

285
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,160
BRAD ANDAC: That's the "Better Than Rapid Innovation".

286
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,896
BRAD ANDAC: Better at competing,
better than the next guy, a better killing machine.

287
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,849
BRAD ANDAC: Isn't it just amazing how century and half of science-fiction
did nothing to swerve our species from the path of doom?

288
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,769
BRAD ANDAC: I mean, I'm… I'm done with that life.

289
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,451
BRAD ANDAC: I mean, I will work hard, twice as hard to earn this.

290
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:44,849
BRAD ANDAC: For my family to have a place in Elysium.

291
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:52,160
BRAD ANDAC: I never thought I… that there could be atonement.

292
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,119
COUNSELLOR: –if you're still nauseous…?

293
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,889
SUSANNE ALPERT: No, the inhibitors have kicked in.

294
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,109
SUSANNE ALPERT: I can't feel the back of my tongue.

295
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,386
SUSANNE ALPERT: I wish I could tell you I'd believe in this.

296
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:13,938
SUSANNE ALPERT: But the damage is too great, too extensive, too complete.

297
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,908
SUSANNE ALPERT: With all respect to Dr Sobeck's work at Miriam?

298
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:21,918
SUSANNE ALPERT: No, no! Life doesn't always find a way to keep going.

299
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,718
SUSANNE ALPERT: Sometimes it never comes back.

300
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:31,480
SUSANNE ALPERT: Like Syzygy East, like the Congo, like Timor, like us.

301
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,739
SUSANNE ALPERT: That's our reward?
A buried city full of terminal patients waiting out the clock?

302
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,138
COUNSELLOR: You'd grow old together with your loved ones in safety.

303
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,118
SUSANNE ALPERT: I don't have loved ones. I suppose I could start a family?

304
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,754
COUNSELLOR: I'm afraid not, all inhabitants of Elysium will be medically sterilised.

305
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:53,102
SUSANNE ALPERT: [exasperation noises]

306
00:34:53,102 --> 00:35:00,771
COUNSELLOR: A habitat capable of sustaining a starting base of
two thousand individuals for up to a hundred years is a huge challenge Dr Alpert.

307
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:05,828
COUNSELLOR: If the population grows instead of diminishes,
everyone will be dead inside thirty years.

308
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:11,239
SUSANNE ALPERT: I knew it. I just couldn't bring myself to say the words.

309
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,338
COUNSELLOR: I'm sorry?

310
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,360
SUSANNE ALPERT: Finish it. Medical euthanasia.

311
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,539
SUSANNE ALPERT: I want no part of this. I just want it over.

312
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,590
COUNSELLOR: I see.

313
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,340
COUNSELLOR: Protocols require a 48-hour waiting period after which—

314
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,661
RON FELDER: Is he to make sure I behave this time?

315
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,226
COUNSELLOR: Security, for your protection.

316
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,283
COUNSELLOR: Would you like to discuss how you're feeling?

317
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,460
RON FELDER: Sure, I'll tell you.

318
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,822
RON FELDER: Surprised. No, flabbergasted.

319
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,949
RON FELDER: Like my old man would say, flabbergasted.

320
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,778
RON FELDER: That vein pumping in his forehead. I'd thought…

321
00:35:55,778 --> 00:36:00,886
RON FELDER: I'd thought you people were
just completely under-prepared for a spaceflight project.

322
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:04,650
RON FELDER: But now I can see it's worse, much worse.

323
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,488
RON FELDER: Sobeck is a total fantasist, a dangerous fantasist.

324
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:14,621
RON FELDER: This kind of blue-skying i-i-its … Jesus!

325
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:17,317
RON FELDER: I'm sorry we wasted each other's time.

326
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,348
RON FELDER: I'm ready to leave now.

327
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,078
COUNSELLOR: I'm afraid that's not possible.

328
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,628
RON FELDER: Ha! Everything you're talking about here isn't possible!

329
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,728
COUNSELOR: I recommend you read the documents regarding your options.

330
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,827
RON FELDER: I've seen enough. I'm getting out of here.

331
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,556
RON FELDER: What are you…? You don't…! Get your hands off me!

332
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,487
COMPUTER: Alert. Medical wing inaccessible.

333
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,828
ECLIPSE: Intruder! Get her!

334
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,769
SYLENS: Whatever you do, don't die now!

335
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,267
ECLIPSE: Bleed before the shadow!

336
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,312
ECLIPSE: Close in!

337
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:42,700
ECLIPSE: Guide me—

338
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,426
ECLIPSE: Let this strike upon—

339
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:52,905
ECLIPSE: —not make it. 

340
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:12,351
ECLIPSE: To destroy the unworthy!

341
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:18,345
ECLIPSE: What else you got?!

342
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,336
ECLIPSE: Face the Sun's judgement!

343
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:38,976
ECLIPSE: I'll feel that tomorrow. That hurt!

344
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,920
TOM PAECH: I hashed it out with them.

345
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,624
TOM PAECH: What the point of Artemis was.

346
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,130
TOM PAECH: I made it clear I wasn't on board for a global zoo.

347
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:40,340
TOM PAECH: We haven't exactly proved ourselves
to be great custodians in the past few thousand years.

348
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,730
TOM PAECH: So the idea of a reconstituted biosphere…

349
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,429
TOM PAECH: Well, it's horrifying, isn't it?

350
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,368
TOM PAECH: A complete horror show.

351
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:52,108
TOM PAECH: We have no right to take a best guess at this stuff.

352
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,615
TOM PAECH: But the alternative? Nothingness.

353
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,562
TOM PAECH: For there to have been all this and then… nothing.

354
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:03,331
TOM PAECH: And with Charles Ronson running the show?

355
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:07,800
TOM PAECH: I respect him. He's got a passion to him, he's hot-blooded.

356
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,472
TOM PAECH: So I said I'll do it. I'll put my all into this, literally.

357
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,305
TOM PAECH: When the project is done I'll take the medical option, thank you.

358
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:19,182
TOM PAECH: Counsellor said I might change my mind.

359
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,019
TOM PAECH: I told him that he didn't know me very well, then.

360
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,728
TOM PAECH: For life's sake I'll do the dirty work.

361
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,920
TOM PAECH: But I want no part of this pathetic attenuated future on offer.

362
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,809
TOM PAECH: I'm an outdoors man.

363
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,000
TOM PAECH: Never did like the feel of solid-state lighting on my skin.

364
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,110
TOM PAECH: And a wee bit of a claustrophobe anyway.

365
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:50,413
DR. HSU-VHEY: Zero Dawn. It is art, in a way.

366
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,498
DR. HSU-VHEY: An expression on the grandest scale.

367
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,820
DR. HSU-VHEY: But there is so much unfairness.

368
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,309
DR. HSU-VHEY: Why was I chosen?

369
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,546
DR. HSU-VHEY: Was it decided by committee, by algorithm?

370
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,738
DR. HSU-VHEY: My family will be saved
because I happen to graduate in art history?

371
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:07,420
DR. HSU-VHEY: Is this right?

372
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,275
MALE VOICE: Dr Hsu-Vhey? Christina Hsu-Vhey?

373
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:12,517
DR. HSU-VHEY: Yes?

374
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:14,909
[recording interrupted]

375
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:17,567
DR. HSU-VHEY: I met a man, another historian.

376
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:20,828
DR. HSU-VHEY: His fields are Bauhaus and the New Materialists.

377
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,518
DR. HSU-VHEY: But he once attended one of my talks.

378
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,619
DR. HSU-VHEY: Another unfair chance.

379
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:31,030
DR. HSU-VHEY: Of all the many people
in that auditorium, that we should both be here now?

380
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,818
DR. HSU-VHEY: And yet I feel more accepting of my fate.

381
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,776
DR. HSU-VHEY: No, it is not fair, not at all.

382
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:42,283
DR. HSU-VHEY: But for the sake of my family, for the sake of art…

383
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:43,978
DR. HSU-VHEY: Art is alive!

384
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,668
DR. HSU-VHEY: It must be able
to speak from beyond history and echo in the future.

385
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,010
DR. HSU-VHEY: Not perish into oblivion.

386
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,809
DR. HSU-VHEY: This opportunity? I must do this.

387
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,536
TRAVIS TATE: Now, those lame FBI black hats at Mockingbird back in the day?

388
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,069
TRAVIS TATE: I enjoyed schooling them.

389
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,210
TRAVIS TATE: But maybe I went in too hard on this poor counsellor.

390
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:15,115
TRAVIS TATE: She was cute, and just going down a checklist after all.

391
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:18,610
TRAVIS TATE: Couldn't expect her to see how ridiculous Zero D's ambitions are.

392
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,994
TRAVIS TATE: God's own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor?

393
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:25,717
TRAVIS TATE: Palms up, honey, I'm just calling it like it is.

394
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:28,439
TRAVIS TATE: "Hey look Mom, I'm making nature!"

395
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:32,139
TRAVIS TATE: Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its course?

396
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,693
TRAVIS TATE: Extinction? That's natural. Zero Dawn? No ma'am, that ain't.

397
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,010
TRAVIS TATE: Heck, it's so unnatural it'd be called
an abomination back home and you know it.

398
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:45,300
TRAVIS TATE: That's why you're hiding it.

399
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:49,418
TRAVIS TATE: Meanwhile, my little honey of a counsellor,
she's munching the inside of her cheek.

400
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,408
TRAVIS TATE: Bad habit. She chewed one of her nails too, just one.

401
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,082
TRAVIS TATE: Not your day was it little sweet pea?

402
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:58,648
TRAVIS TATE: Saw her quota slipping away.

403
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:02,652
TRAVIS TATE: Said "I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr Tate?"

404
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,000
TRAVIS TATE: [laugh] Are you kidding me?

405
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,300
TRAVIS TATE: Eighteen months hard labour in exchange
for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?

406
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,409
TRAVIS TATE: Sign me up!

407
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,000
ALOY: Power's down.

408
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,909
SYLENS: Is there another route?

409
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,957
ALOY: I've done this before, just need my Focus.

410
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:23,509
ALOY: Here we go, another one of these.

411
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,000
ALOY: I need to find the right configuration.

412
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,381
ALOY: Done, I should check the door nearby.

413
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:18,780
ALOY: Found one, looks intact.

414
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:48,579
ALOY: That should do the trick.

415
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:50,989
ALOY: Now let's get that door open.

416
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:01,280
PARKER: Hey, I'm done with Brett's incompetence, okay?

417
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,817
PARKER: Somehow he managed to install an H-emitter node backwards.

418
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,468
PARKER: Everything's in reverse.

419
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:08,377
PARKER: I don't get paid to clean up Brett's messes.

420
00:49:08,377 --> 00:49:12,331
PARKER: If you want it fixed, send him up to storage for a new emitter, not me.

421
00:49:12,331 --> 00:49:13,546
PARKER: Parker out.

422
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,537
ALOY: That did it, door should have power.

423
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:38,134
SYLENS: Now to see what lies beyond it.

424
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:03,000
ALOY: Eclipse, they're here.

425
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,875
SYLENS: Avoid contact!
