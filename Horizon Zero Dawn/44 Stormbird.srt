1
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,420
VARGA: Everyone wants boring old bows and spears.

2
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,124
VARGA: I like the more unusual stuff and the Banuk can get unusual.

3
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:32,422
Like that spear Aratak hauls around, an Icerail!

4
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:34,589
Oooh, or that weapon of Ourea's?

5
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,383
What I wouldn't give to poke around inside one of those.

6
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,490
Feel the lightning on my fingers.

7
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,629
So let's say someone you know happened to have a weapon like Ourea's…

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,617
VARGA: You don't!

9
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:45,449
ALOY: See for yourself.

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,754
VARGA: Of course, look at the…

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,350
…so the coils generate the spark, but the power source isn't even bolted in.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,670
I won't lie, she's beautiful.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,475
But there's beautiful and then there's BEAUTIFUL.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,370
What we need is a Stormbird talon,
lightning flows over them like water off a goose.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,006
So we need parts from a Stormbird and a Thunderjaw?

16
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,338
And you know where to find them?

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,958
That's right. It's gonna take some travelling, though.

18
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,670
A Stormbird roosts near the Free Heap. I'll pack and meet you out there.

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,608
This'll be fun!

20
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,438
Okay.

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,849
Hunt it with me, I'll turn that weapon into your new best friend.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,650
Mmm, second best.

23
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,560
They're scanning for me.

24
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,006
Those machines are alarmed.

25
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,350
There, it fits.

26
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,790
I just need to slot in one more.

27
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,350
That's two.

28
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,855
It's some kind of code.

29
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,170
Maybe there's a clue nearby.

30
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,790
Did it, now to check the door.

31
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,019
Those clamps have the armour locked in place.

32
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,155
Maybe there's a way to power up the mechanism, release the clamps?

33
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,192
Just need to install these power cells, that should do it.

34
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,990
Getting soaked from melted snow.

35
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,252
[whistle]

36
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:33,222
[whistle]

37
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:19,333
Home, to think he built all this alone.

38
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,889
So many memories.

39
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,580
It's not home anymore.

40
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,259
Not without Rost.

41
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,789
Hi Rost.

42
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,649
Uh, I'll just take this off.

43
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,980
Don't want him listening in.

44
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,259
Hi Rost.

45
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,850
A lot has happened.

46
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,009
The killers from the Proving, they aren't gonna hurt anyone anymore.

47
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,059
I tracked them to Devil's Grief.

48
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,058
There was a battle, and we won.

49
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,650
Varl, he…

50
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,089
made an impression.

51
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,630
Has some mother issues, but I like him.

52
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,765
Elisabet Sobeck, she couldn't have been my mother.

53
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,543
She was an Old One, she lived ages ago.

54
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,349
Still, there is a connection.

55
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,309
The hatch, it thought I was her.

56
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,510
It's… it's really strange.

57
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,450
Somehow Elisabet stopped war machines from destroying the world.

58
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,834
She couldn't save the civilisation of the Old Ones, that was destroyed, obviously.

59
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:51,167
But life, it survived.

60
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,746
She saved life from being devoured.

61
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:01,589
I need to know how Elisabet stopped the machines.

62
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,752
If I can find the weapon she built and use it, the Eclipse won't stand a chance.

63
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,950
Speaking of the Eclipse.

64
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,450
I think I had a run in with Hades.

65
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:25,099
I picked up a Focus, and it was like a cloud or dark swarm of something.

66
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,972
But its voice, it was terrible.

67
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:37,396
I don't know what Hades is or what it wants, but it's evil.

68
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,931
No other way to describe it.

69
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,779
I went into the Grave-Hoard.

70
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,950
It lived up to its name.

71
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:55,415
Millions of people fought and died
to give Elisabet the time she needed to finish Zero Dawn.

72
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,125
The weapon she built it wasn't there, but I found out where she built it.

73
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,349
A secret base, west of here.

74
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,490
Right under Sunfall, the capital of the Shadow Carja.

75
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,996
So getting inside its, well, it's gonna take some doing.

76
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:23,259
Before I can get into the Zero Dawn base
I'm gonna have to crash the Eclipse Focus network.

77
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,289
It's, uh, it's complicated.

78
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,940
I know where to go.

79
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,669
Sylens says it won't be too dangerous.

80
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,569
But since when do I trust him?

81
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,880
I've got to do it.

82
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,259
I need to know what Elisabet built.

83
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,409
The weapon that stopped the war machines.

84
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:50,500
And the connection between us, it's … it's still a mystery.

85
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,309
One I intend to solve.

86
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,660
Guess I should be going.

87
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,888
[whistle]

88
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,130
NORA BRAVE: Come on, hit!

89
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,475
It'd be fascinating, if they weren't looking for me.

90
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,039
Uh, going down fast!

91
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,198
VARGA: You know, I kind of missed all this red dust.

92
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,578
VARGA: Well, there's our Stormbird.

93
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,349
VARGA: When you're ready I'll follow up and boom!

94
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,780
VARGA: I'm going…!

95
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,009
ALOY: Got you now!

96
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,278
Stay still!

97
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:13,486
Varga said she could improve the Stormslinger with this.

98
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,269
Just stay out of their way for now.

99
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,468
Found the part, one Stormbird talon.

100
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:54,868
Let's do it!

101
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:57,190
I haven't had this much fun in ages.

102
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,181
Watch and learn, Aloy.

103
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:02,420
Only don't stare directly at the sparks.

104
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:07,848
Okay, so I pretty much had to break her in half.

105
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:09,168
But what's a staff?

106
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,368
A stick.

107
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,361
One thing I like about sticks,
you can put them back together however you want.

108
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,269
ALOY: Which you did.

109
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,678
This thing looks a whole lot more dangerous.

110
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,618
She's better than dangerous.

111
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:23,151
She's a genuine Varga special now.

112
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,280
Take good care of her.

113
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:28,165
Never thought I'd be glad to see the inside of a Thunderjaw's mouth.

114
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:33,068
I sure am! Every machine's a big box of tools.

115
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,564
Once they stop trying to kill you, that is.

116
00:49:35,564 --> 00:49:39,489
Trust me Aloy, you won't recognise this Icerail when I'm through.

117
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,659
There! Aah, she's perfect.

118
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:46,527
A spear's a spear, right?

119
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,230
Poke, slash, done.

120
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:49,409
Boring!

121
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:57,980
I adjusted the Chillwater flow, rebalanced here,
strapped on a launcher, and now she shoots freezing spikes! Ta-da!

122
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,028
You weren't kidding.

123
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,808
More beautiful, more powerful.

124
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,550
That was some impressive work, Varga.

125
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,888
Hey, it's nothing.

126
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:09,190
I just helped her become what she was always meant to be.

127
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,608
They grow up so fast.

128
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,533
Show me what you had in mind for the Forgefire.

129
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,348
Finally! Was feeling like I'd neglected her.

130
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,070
And that's a little too close to my family life.

131
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,849
She's done and she's yours.

132
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:24,019
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

133
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,679
Huh, looks great!

134
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,480
I almost expected you to turn it into a burning Ropecaster or something.

135
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,528
Nah, she was close to perfect from the start.

136
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,269
She's a Varga original after all.

137
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,391
You've done good work with this weapon, Varga.

138
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:38,780
Told you I was good.

139
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,480
Anyway, I'm glad she's in your hands.

140
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:44,349
Thanks Varga, these three weapons are fine work.

141
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:45,608
Are you kidding?

142
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,718
I can't remember when I had this much fun!

143
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:48,838
I should be thanking you.

144
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,253
I'm the one walking away with the weapons aren't I?

145
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:55,179
Seems wrong to charge you for giving me an opportunity to do what I love doing.

146
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:57,077
Don't tell Pop I said that.

147
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,832
Here, whenever I tinker with weapons, I go through fistfuls of this stuff.

148
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,900
Maybe you'll get some use out of it.
