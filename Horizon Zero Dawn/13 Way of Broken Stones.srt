1
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,839
Is there anything more you can tell me about the road to Meridian?

2
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,800
Sun-King Avad has devoted considerable resources to making it safe.

3
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,552
But by the Sun's witness,
it's been harder to control in peace than it was during the war.

4
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:34,949
Machines grow more dangerous all the time.

5
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,253
Add to that bandits, and new reports of this corruption.

6
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,920
We're stretched thin to protect a few outposts like this one.

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,750
As for everywhere else.

8
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,609
Well, travel at your own risk.

9
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,976
The world beyond the Sacred Land.

10
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:58,682
I need to find Olin and learn everything he knows.

11
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:02,550
Who the killers were, how they saw me through his Focus.

12
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,620
Who the woman is, the one who looks like me.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
Why they want me dead.

14
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,209
Olin's trail leads to Meridian.

15
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,709
When I catch him, he will talk.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,019
And he will pay for all the lives he's ruined.

17
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:51,410
[Bandit]
Stop messing around and show yourself!

18
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,620
[Bandit]
Come out, I'll make it quick!

19
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,920
[Bandit]
If you won't fight, why don't you run on home!

20
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,310
[Bandit]
Show your face so I can slice it off!

21
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:57,410
[Carja outlander]
I don't want to die away from Meridian!

22
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,884
[Carja outlander]
Help me! My life is on the line!

23
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,800
[Carja outlander]
Help! I want to see the sun rise again!

24
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,410
[Bandit]
Got you located!

25
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,059
Don't mind me.

26
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,620
[Bandit]
Right here, you …

27
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,310
[Bandit]
Disappeared.

28
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,819
[Bandit]
I won't quit 'til I find you.

29
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,769
Rost always said "patience".

30
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,410
Can stop tensing up.

31
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,620
They're scanning for me.

32
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,529
[Carja guard]
Should be out there fighting machines not pacing around here.

33
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,220
[Carja outlander]
It's a crime. I should report it to the Sun Court.

34
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,690
[Carja guard]
I have nothing for you, I'm afraid.

35
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,250
[Carja guard]
We all have our place in the order of things.

36
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,119
[Carja outlander]
This isn't up to their usual standard.

37
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,940
[Carja outlander]
I've seen this four times already.

38
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,720
[Carja outlander]
Oh, wonderful.

39
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,809
[Carja outlander]
Perfect weather for a walk.

40
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:50,509
[Carja guard]
I'm sorry for the wait, but all goods entering the city are subject to search.

41
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,768
[Carja merchant]
This is outrageous. We are loyal citizens!

42
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,364
[Carja merchant]
How long do we have to wait?

43
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:59,029
[Carja merchant]
What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and let everything spoil?

44
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,696
[Carja merchant]
I thought Meridian was open to all Carja.

45
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:06,970
[Carja merchant]
What happened to Ersa has nothing to do with us.

46
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,109
[Carja artisan]
Eh, I've seen better.

47
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,930
[Carja merchant]
If I don't get my goods to the buyer soon, they'll cancel the contract.

48
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,899
What's going on here?

49
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,009
Olin's in there somewhere.

50
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,699
And so's Erend.

51
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,723
That other Outlander I talked to the night before the Proving.

52
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:35,069
Erend said he'd introduce me to his sister if I visited Meridian.

53
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,789
Said she was Captain of the Vanguard.

54
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,669
[Carja merchant]
Just finish your business here and be gone, outlander.

55
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:57,210
[Carja artisan]
City's locked down on account of the murder.

56
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,500
[Carja guard]
Good luck getting through, outlander.

57
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,618
[Carja artisan]
If this keeps up, I'll be broke in a month.

58
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,700
[Carja guard]
We all have our place in the order of things.

59
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,410
[Carja merchant]
It's always the merchants who suffer.

60
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,750
[Carja guard]
Hold!

61
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,659
Stop right there.

62
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,889
In light of the recent attack,
no stranger passes into Meridian without submitting to search.

63
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,199
Recent attack?

64
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,710
What are you talking about?

65
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,709
The murder of Captain Ersa and her Vanguards, Of course.

66
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,990
Ambushed by Shadow Carja forces in Red Ridge Pass.

67
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,599
Ersa? You mean Erend's sister is dead?

68
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,529
How would you know his name?

69
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,690
I know Erend. Summon him.

70
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,869
I need to speak to him.

71
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,930
Ha!

72
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,729
I doubt that Erend, the new Captain of the Vanguard,
a man in grief, is going to waste his time on a grimy outlander.

73
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,529
Aloy! Hey, you're alive!

74
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,368
I thought you were dead.

75
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,649
Make way! Make way!

76
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,299
All the way to Meridian just to see me?

77
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,200
Have you been drinking?

78
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,389
Ah, not really.

79
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,230
A little.

80
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,009
So you're alive.

81
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,598
We should celebrate it.

82
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,799
Drinks on me!

83
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,534
We need to talk alone and you need to pull together.

84
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,599
Over there.

85
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,420
So you approve?

86
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,599
Of course I approve.

87
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,809
From now on, she may come and go from this city as she pleases.

88
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,609
As you wish, sir.

89
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,230
There, alone as you asked.

90
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,619
What did you want to tell me?

91
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,720
I heard what happened to Ersa.

92
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,109
I'm sorry.

93
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,420
I know she was special to you.

94
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,009
Special to me?

95
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,819
Ha!

96
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,920
Special to everyone.

97
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,618
She always knew what to do.

98
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:10,200
Bossed everyone around.

99
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,009
She kept me in line.

100
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,194
Now I'm supposed to fill her shoes.

101
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:19,410
Instead here I am stumbling around in them.

102
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,369
Give yourself some time.

103
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,710
You'll find your footing.

104
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,210
Not at the rate I've been drinking.

105
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,298
And what would your sister have said about that?

106
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,819
I know, you're right.

107
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,200
I should expect more of myself.

108
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,200
She always did.

109
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:38,109
Then stop feeling sorry for yourself and live up to her example.

110
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,599
So much for a shoulder to cry on.

111
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,099
Everybody loses people they care about.

112
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,609
I, uh … I lost someone too.

113
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,910
At the Proving, the man who raised me.

114
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,410
His name was Rost.

115
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,410
That's terrible.

116
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,311
But why is it every time something terrible happens,

117
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,723
everyone else tells you the worst thing that ever happened to them,

118
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,210
as though that makes it easier?

119
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,229
Yeah.

120
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,309
Why is that?

121
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,920
Anyway, there is something you wanted to tell me?

122
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,710
A lot has happened since we last spoke.

123
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,930
The Proving was attacked by a group of killers.

124
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,439
Not many of us survived.

125
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,819
We were in the village when we heard explosions up on the mountain.

126
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,139
Some of your Braves came back.

127
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,210
Said most of the contestants were dead.

128
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,909
I've never heard such a wail of grief as the sound that rose up from your people.

129
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,109
How did you survive?

130
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,309
How I survived is less important than how I was targeted.

131
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,700
Targeted?

132
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,299
What do you mean?

133
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,619
The killers came for me because of Olin.

134
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,009
But he's a friend.

135
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,319
No, he's a traitor.

136
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,056
I don't know who the killers are or what they want,

137
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:56,299
but I do know that Olin is working with them.

138
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,753
But … I mean … this …

139
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,950
I don't need you to understand, Erend.

140
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,829
I just need you to take me to him.

141
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,319
He's not here.

142
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,828
He went scrounging for scrap and relics days ago.

143
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,029
He could be anywhere.

144
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,959
Are there any places he frequents?

145
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,700
Places he returns to?

146
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,119
A house, here in Meridian.

147
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,048
Okay, then take me there.

148
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,430
I need to search it.

149
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,829
I guess, as long as I'm there to witness the search.

150
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,109
So many people here, all talking at once.

151
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,709
How does anyone think?

152
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,210
[Erend]
I don't, I just drink.

153
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,745
[Carja merchant]
I've got all the best goods here.

154
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,593
[Carja snob]
That girl, is she a Nora?

155
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:53,519
[Carja snob]
Apparently they're letting anyone into the city these days.

156
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:03,609
[in the distance]
How long will Avad hide in his palace? To lay siege to the Citadel?

157
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,429
Does he lack the stomach for justice?

158
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,562
Blood for blood! Vengeance for Ersa!

159
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:17,846
Year after year,
why does he spare those who enslaved and tortured and butchered?

160
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,467
Erend!

161
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,806
You should want vengeance more than anyone.

162
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:26,548
Your own sister murdered and her death unavenged.

163
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:29,818
One more word you scorched-out slag.

164
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,569
And I'll throw you in jail myself.

165
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,499
Get out of here.

166
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,930
Or I'll give you all the kick in the ass!

167
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,739
What did he mean about Ersa's murder?

168
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,720
[Erend]
Not now.

169
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:03,779
Okay, how are we going to get in?

170
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:11,420
Oh, that was … subtle.

171
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,019
[Erend]
Here we are. Try not to break anything. Other than the door.

172
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,730
[Aloy]
All of this for one man.

173
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,990
[Erend]
It pays to have connections in the Sun-King's court.

174
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,210
Does he know the Sun-King personally?

175
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,669
No.

176
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,288
He served the court as a scout sometimes and sold ancient trinkets to nobles.

177
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,619
But he never had an audience with the King.

178
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:41,439
If you're right and Olin's into something dark,
Sun-King Avad has nothing to do with it.

179
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,150
I'd stake my life on that.

180
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,109
Did Olin ever invite you in?

181
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,410
Nah.

182
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,720
Closest I got was a doorstep to help him home after a night out.

183
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,930
We drank a river that night, but I hold it well, usually.

184
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,700
Are you sure you're okay?

185
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,608
I'm sober enough, all right?

186
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:02,200
I don't need another lecture.

187
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,910
That's not what I meant.

188
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:07,220
I was talking about what happened outside with the crowd.

189
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,430
I don't wanna talk about that.

190
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,318
We're here because of what you said about Olin.

191
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,309
So do what you need to do.

192
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,339
The corner of this rug is frayed, and the floor near it is worn.

193
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's see what's underneath.

194
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,940
Hey, how did that get here?

195
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,437
Question is how to get through it.

196
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:45,199
Without a key, you won't.

197
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,459
That's a vault hatch of Oseram make.

198
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,739
Nothing gets through.

199
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,250
We'll see about that.

200
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,799
[Erend]
Call it a day, girl. You're wasting time.

201
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,170
Looks big and heavy.

202
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,619
Could do a lot of damage if it fell down.

203
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,019
Let's give it a little push.

204
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,940
I did say not to break anything, didn't I?

205
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,210
It looks like a picture of Olin's family.

206
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,099
Time to get to the bottom of this.

207
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,029
Looks like Olin kept a journal.

208
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,990
[Erend]
Olin?

209
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:01,162
[Erend]
I knew he could read contracts, but I never took him for a poet.

210
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:04,529
No doubt now, Olin knew I was targeted.

211
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,309
A map.

212
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,309
The glyphs show places he visited.

213
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,509
[hologram]
Serve and they live.

214
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:42,009
[hologram]
Disobey and I will open their throats and leave their corpses to prune in the sun.

215
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,299
They took his wife and child captive.

216
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,210
They?

217
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
Who's they?

218
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,029
The killers.

219
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,799
They told him to obey or they kill his family.

220
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,119
There's your proof.

221
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,700
Read the last page.

222
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,710
He writes about meeting me and the order to kill me.

223
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,910
He called himself a friend.

224
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,230
That backstabbing cheat.

225
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,771
How did you learn to read glyphs?

226
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:17,718
And these things that you see, how do you do it?

227
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,010
The Focus.

228
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,885
It reveals the unseen.

229
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,427
And Olin's Focus? It's the same?

230
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,564
The device is the same, but…

231
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,358
Somehow Olin and the killers can speak to each other
with their Focuses over distances,

232
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:35,318
and see through each other's Focuses, too.

233
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,719
Like looking through each other's eyes.

234
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,559
So that's how the killers saw you? Through Olin.

235
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,118
Yes, so far as I can tell.

236
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,477
Now that I know where to find Olin, I should be on my way.

237
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:49,809
All by yourself?

238
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,318
Leave it to me. I'm faster on my own.

239
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,528
Wait!

240
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,082
If that device lets you see the unseen…

241
00:34:57,082 --> 00:34:58,719
Out of the way, Erend.

242
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,360
I'm asking you to help me, Aloy.

243
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,110
I need to know who killed Ersa.

244
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,768
Not just that the Shadow Carja Army, I know that.

245
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:09,165
But the exact soldiers who did it.

246
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,929
I'm sorry about your sister, but that's your war, not mine.

247
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,338
Don't act like this isn't personal.

248
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,259
You came here hunting the people who nearly killed you.

249
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,210
Who massacred your people!

250
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,840
Why should you have justice and not me?

251
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,599
Look, I'll head for Red Ridge Pass where Ersa's body was found,
and wait for you there.

252
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,619
A few minutes of your Focus is all I need.

253
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,234
Don't make me beg.

254
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,000
Red Ridge Pass you said?

255
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,534
I'll see what I can do.

256
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:18,230
[sniffs] Spice! 

257
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,000
[Carja merchant]
An Oseram would argue with the sun itself.

258
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,937
Smells like nothing I've ever smelled before.

259
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,409
Is that some kind of spice?

260
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:31,678
Hmm, you're an outlander.

261
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,590
Nora from the look of you.

262
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,699
I bet you're a machine hunter too.

263
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,590
I've hunted my share.

264
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,738
I'm known as a skilled hunter back home in Ban-Ur.

265
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,948
So I thought I'd try my luck at the lodge.

266
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:46,309
I thought I'd be simple. Hunt machines, gain ranks, see who's best.

267
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,400
But it doesn't work like that at all.

268
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,199
It's all rigged to keep the Carja at the head of the line.

269
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,400
If you're not Carja, you'll never rise in the ranks.

270
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,282
When Sun-King Avad took over, he promised a new day.

271
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,966
Meridian open to all. But it's a sham.

272
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,809
Sure you can get a seat at the feast, but you just can't eat the food.

273
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,989
Sounds like someone needs to shake things up with the lodge.

274
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,710
Maybe, but it isn't gonna be me.

275
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,989
I don't need those snobs to tell me I can hunt. I'm going home.

276
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:23,063
If you decide to go, be sure to give them a good,
old-fashioned Banuk farewell mark, in my honour.

277
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:25,517
A "Banuk farewell mark"? What's that?

278
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,480
Piss on the floor.

279
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,289
Preferably someplace they won't find it until it gets nice and sour.

280
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,001
[Carja outlander]
The people here won't stand for tyranny.

281
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,110
[Carja outlander]
Meridian has proven itself above such things.

282
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:41,743
[Carja merchant]
Only the finest goods here, see for yourself.

283
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,880
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up on these goods.

284
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:53,358
[Carja guard]
Meridian is a marvel of engineering that has stood for generations.

285
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,909
[Carja merchant]
Fine goods for a fair price.

286
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:59,732
[Carja guard]
Machines or bandits try to get past me, they'll have a fight.

287
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,418
[Carja merchant]
These aren't goods, they're necessities!

288
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,800
[Carja merchant]
Check out these wares!

289
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:36,389
[Carja guard]
The Nora will survive. They always do, it's that barbarian resilience.

290
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:05,690
You need to win three Half Suns at our Hunting Grounds
to gain admittance to the lodge.

291
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,447
You mean these?

292
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:08,820
Very well then.

293
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,300
Congratulations and welcome.

294
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:16,190
Our members reap rewards and adventure and live on in legend.

295
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,690
Am I a member now?

296
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,398
No, you're only a fledgling.

297
00:39:20,398 --> 00:39:22,550
Junior members are called Thrushes.

298
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:28,199
To join and become a Thrush,
you need a senior member called a Hawk to sponsor you.

299
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,579
So I need to find a Hawk.

300
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,108
Yes, but a Hawk can only sponsor one hunter at a time.

301
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,610
And I'm afraid most of them already have one.

302
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,550
I have overcome worse odds.

303
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,800
Where do I start?

304
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,146
Upstairs.

305
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:47,300
Present yourself to the Sunhawk Ahsis, our leader,
who should introduce you to a Hawk.

306
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,079
I hope it's worth it.

307
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,409
What do you mean?

308
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,780
You'll see.

309
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,940
By the Sun!

310
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,780
King Avad's edict really is taking effect.

311
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:23,000
I never thought I'd see a Nora here! And a woman at that.

312
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,570
What edict?

313
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:27,138
King Avad insisted that the Hunters Lodge had to welcome everyone.

314
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:31,779
Man, woman, outlander, regardless of tribe.

315
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,878
Ersa, Captain of the Vanguard, came in and delivered that news personally.

316
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,063
You should have been there, it was glorious!

317
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:43,389
But I figured they would sweep it under the rug
and say no woman or outlander qualified.

318
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,434
Yet here you are.

319
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:46,915
Are you a member?

320
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:48,400
Me? No.

321
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,690
Carja don't exactly encourage their daughters to run around hunting machines.

322
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,199
But all the changes in Meridian have been good to me.

323
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,619
So you have marks for me?

324
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,079
What do you mean?

325
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:01,750
From the Hunting Grounds.

326
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,899
Oh, right. You're new here.

327
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:05,889
What do you want with my marks?

328
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,940
You hunters and your badges.

329
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:09,599
I'm not gonna take them.

330
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,579
I'm going to give you a weapon that sets you apart.

331
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,849
What do I do with these marks?

332
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,570
If you earn marks in all three trials
at each of the five Hunting Grounds, come to me.

333
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,418
I can give you up to three weapons.

334
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,121
One for fifteen Half Suns,

335
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:25,899
one for fifteen Full Suns,

336
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:28,699
and one you'll love for all Blazing Suns!

337
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,289
I need a few more.

338
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:33,992
Okay,  once you get marks from the trials at every Hunting Ground,

339
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:37,079
come back and we'll see what I can give you.

340
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,579
What have we here?

341
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,360
A Nora fledge.

342
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,980
Bet I've been hunting longer than you have.

343
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,219
Are you a fledgling?

344
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:02,528
Not for long.

345
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,178
I have a Hawk who's about to sponsor me.

346
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:05,510
So you're out of luck.

347
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,548
Typical savage barging in here without a thought,
right after one of our own was killed.

348
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,440
Go away.

349
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,928
I've been trophy hunting for years.

350
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,969
Still haven't gotten a sponsor.

351
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,559
I'd ask Talanah to sponsor me, but her sponsor just died.

352
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,570
Can't imagine what she must be going through.

353
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,617
Excuse us.

354
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:47,369
Ah, the machine rider graces us with her presence.

355
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:49,671
You're a Nora, are you not?

356
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,880
A fighter from the savage lands.

357
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,178
The Sacred Land.
But yes, I fought for everything I got.

358
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,247
Huh.

359
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,980
Tell me, do the Nora often wander into other people's homes
and do whatever they like?

360
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,869
Of course not.

361
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:09,179
But that is what you're doing, right now.

362
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:14,059
Stinking up our lodge, pestering your betters.

363
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,889
You're hardly my better.

364
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,119
Ligan said I had to meet you to become a member.

365
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,468
That would be true if there were any chance of you becoming a member.

366
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:25,523
But you're a savage.

367
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:32,173
And no savage will rise in the ranks of the Hunters Lodge
while I am the Sunhawk.

368
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,389
Now begone.

369
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:37,046
No, I was led to believe there are rules here.

370
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:39,858
If they count for nothing than even your position is meaningless.

371
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,550
So quit blustering and tell me, is there a hawk who is free to sponsor me?

372
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:45,760
Very well.

373
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,409
Talanah is free.

374
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,550
Wouldn't that be fitting? Trash sponsoring trash.

375
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:55,619
Now get out of my sight.

376
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:31,489
You're Talanah?

377
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:34,800
Ahsis said you were a Hawk without a fledgling to sponsor.

378
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,460
Or are you trying to drive me off too?

379
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:39,569
It's okay. I've dealt with worse.

380
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,750
Mmm, I'll bet you have.

381
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,349
But you're wrong.

382
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,760
It's not okay, especially not today.

383
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:48,139
What happened today?

384
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,659
One of our own just died fighting Redmaw.

385
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:53,617
You'll never face a more dangerous Thunderjaw

386
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,860
Cuts through trees, rocks, people.

387
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,915
I'm sorry to hear that.

388
00:45:58,915 --> 00:46:00,269
It's part of the hunt.

389
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,698
Is there any actual hunting in this lodge?

390
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:04,478
So far, it's been all talk.

391
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,789
Yes, of course.

392
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,713
You fight a machine, then bring its trophy to Ahsis the Sunhawk.

393
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:13,081
Then no-one can deny you brought it down.

394
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:15,059
Ahsis, what's his story?

395
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:20,954
He's the Sunhawk of the lodge, the highest ranking assho– sorry, member.

396
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:23,960
He's taken down Ravagers, Stalkers, Behemoths.

397
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,949
So? I've taken down a lot of machines.

398
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:30,760
As have I. Even brought down two Stormbirds.

399
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,250
But he's a Hawk who brought in the trophies first.

400
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:35,889
That's how it works.

401
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:40,634
Whichever Hawk defeats the greatest machine first becomes the Sunhawk.

402
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,468
Who is this Ligan? The man at the door.

403
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,880
Ligan, he's a Hawk.

404
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,378
He had an impressive run in his day, but he doesn't fight anymore.

405
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,719
He supports the lodge in other ways,

406
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,098
unlike the other Hawks who hoard all the best kills and drink the bar dry.

407
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,176
How does one become a Hawk?

408
00:46:58,176 --> 00:47:02,340
When a Hawk dies, his Thrush is promoted in his place.

409
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,735
No matter how anyone feels about it.

410
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:08,049
I'm ready to hunt. So tell me, what do I have to do?

411
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,469
You want them to regret looking down on you?

412
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,408
Then speak to them in their language.

413
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:15,834
Kill three Sawtooths, two Ravagers and a Stalker.

414
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:19,650
Deliver their trophies directly to Ahsis, that should shut them all up.

415
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,159
So if I do that, you'll sponsor me.

416
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:25,539
I'll consider it, just to make Ahsis boil.
