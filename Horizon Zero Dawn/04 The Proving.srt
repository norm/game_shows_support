1
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,420
Who was my mother?

2
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,300
Aloy, I've told you before, that's not for us to know.

3
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,920
You were just a newborn when
the Matriarchs brought you to me.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
So the Matriarchs, they know?

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,580
It's not so simple.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,040
But they know?

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,600
Aloy, we are outcasts.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,660
So how do I make them tell me?

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,320
The Matriarchs? There is a way, perhaps…

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,180
So tell me.

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,660
It would be dangerous.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,200
How?

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
It would take years of training.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,160
I don't care.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
How do I do it?

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
Tell me!

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,420
The Proving!

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,420
The tribe's rite of passage held every year.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,600
Those who pass become Braves.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,140
But to the one who wins,
the Matriarchs grant a boon.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,960
A boon?

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,060
Yes, whatever the winner wants.

23
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,880
Aloy, we must speak.

24
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,560
So, it's time.

25
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,980
Are you ready?

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,060
Yes. I guess.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,440
It's louder than I expected.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,160
You've never been so close before.

29
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
I guess everything's bigger up close.

30
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,720
Soon it'll all seem familiar.
Like home.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
I don't know about that.

32
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,140
Look for High Matriarch Teersa.

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
She'll help you.

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,560
Any other concerns?

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,120
Any final lessons before I head in?

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
No. You've learned every lesson the wilds had to teach.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,360
It was you who taught me, not the wilds.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
Not sure my bow and spear
will be much help in there though.

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,660
It is with bow and spear that you'll win
what you've wanted all these years, Aloy.

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,900
Answers.

41
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,740
What should I expect once I'm inside?

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
There will be people celebrating and feasting.

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,000
More than you've ever seen in one place.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,560
No other village compares to Mother's Heart.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,680
It is the seat of the High Matriarchs.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,660
A centre of Nora life.

47
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,280
A jewel of the sacred land.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,860
Give it time.

49
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,360
And you will grow fond of it, as I was.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,640
Back when I was of the tribe.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Are you sure they're gonna let me in?

52
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,540
I've told you, Aloy.
By law any child outcast can run in the Proving.

53
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,640
And any who pass are made Braves
and are outcast no more.

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
I know that.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,500
But not everyone follows the law like you do, Rost.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,960
Have faith Aloy. The tribe will honour your right.

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm ready to do this.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
See you back home in a few days?

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,580
You will not find me there Aloy.

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,700
Here.

61
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,280
Take this to…

62
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,380
…remember.

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,820
Why are you talking like we'll never see each other again?

64
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,100
No.

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,500
No!

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,140
You should be with the tribe.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
And I will always be an outcast.

68
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,240
But I told you I have that figured out.

69
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
I'll come to you in secret.

70
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,700
I'll be the one breaking the law, not you.

71
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,300
You don't even have to talk to me.

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,780
This…

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,560
…attachment to me will only hold you back.

74
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,620
It's my wish that you embrace the tribe.

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,680
You've lived in isolation long enough.

76
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,900
Not until now I didn't.

77
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,180
For your sake I must go where you will never find me.

78
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,280
This…

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,740
…this is goodbye.

80
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,340
No! It's not!

81
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
You taught me how to track.

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,220
Wherever you go I can follow.

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,620
Not this time.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
I see.

85
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm glad to have this then.

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,200
It will remind me of you.

87
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,200
Of everything you did.

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,300
And how you helped prepare me for this day.

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Thank you.

90
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,060
Heavier than it looks.

91
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,160
But the cord is strong.

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
May All-Mother bless you, Aloy.

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,980
And you.

94
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,060
How could he do this?

95
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,460
Today of all days.

96
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,460
I have to let him go.

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,280
For now.

98
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,800
First the Proving, after that I'll see where his trail leads.

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,200
You will turn back Outcast.

100
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,700
Or bleed.

101
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,680
Your choice.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,520
[in distance]
Make way!

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
Make way! Make way!

104
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,580
Braves stand aside! She is welcome here.

105
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,160
Mother's Heart is open to you child.
Come!

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,220
I assure you most Nora aren't so rude as those idiots.

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,160
You're Teersa?

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,220
[laughs] Who else would I be?

109
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,920
Come on now!

110
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,600
I've been waiting for this day a long time.

111
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,840
You have?

112
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,900
Oh yes.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,720
But for the moment I must leave you.

114
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,060
I have other outsiders to keep safe tonight.

115
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,520
You … what?

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,300
Envoys from another tribe, the Carja.

117
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
Come to observe the Proving.

118
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,000
And oh, how the Nora hate the Carja.

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,720
"Carja."

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,760
But that's my problem.

121
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,920
We will talk later.
In the meantime enjoy the festival.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Oh, down the path to the right you'll find
an old friend who can't wait to see you.

123
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
But I don't know anyone here.

124
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,320
[laughs] Try telling him that.

125
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,620
We will talk later. May the Goddess protect!

126
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,480
What is going on?

127
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,320
[constant drumming]

128
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,200
[crowd member] The festival before
my sister's proving had much better music.

129
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,680
[in the distance]
Aloy! It's you isn't it?

130
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,340
Over here!

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,240
It is Aloy isn't it?I'm remembering your name correctly?

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,420
Are you the old friend Teersa told me about?

133
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't know you.

134
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,580
I see you don't recognise me.

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,980
Well it was a long time ago.

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
Teb is my name.

137
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,360
You were half my size when you saved me from a herd of machines.

138
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,420
I remember.

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,080
You tried to thank me.

140
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
I never forgot that day

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,160
All these years I hoped to see you again,
if you came to run in the Proving.

142
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,580
As you can see, I didn't turn out to be much of a Hunter.

143
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,180
I serve the tribe as a Stitcher instead.

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,440
A maker of garments and armour.

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
In preparation for this day I've made an outfit for you.

146
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
I hope you like it.

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,120
What's it going to cost?

148
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,120
Cost? Nothing.

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,840
Consider it the thanks I tried to give years ago.

150
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Long overdue.

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,660
There.

152
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,780
Seems to fit you perfectly.

153
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
Uh, thank you Teb.

154
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,220
I've never had anything like this before.

155
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,900
Well it's yours.

156
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,020
I think you'll find it affords more protection
than what you were wearing.

157
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,140
Anyway.

158
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,040
I hsouldn't keep you any longer.

159
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Head for the Matriarch's Lodge
if you want to find Teersa.

160
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
You'll know it when you see it.

161
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,400
A large wooden building
with an angry mob waiting outside.

162
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,780
Teersa said something about
envoys from another tribe?

163
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,680
Yes. That's what the mob is angry about.

164
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Carja visiting our Sacred Land for the first time in years.

165
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,920
I'd expect to see some tomatoes flying.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Maybe rocks.

167
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,080
Hopefully not spears.

168
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,700
In any case be ready to duck.

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:12:31,480
🎼
 [singing in another language]

170
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,320
Jarg! Get down from there!

171
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,400
Bad enough you're drunk,
why do you have to go climbing houses?

172
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,680
Oh not supposed to go
climbing on other people's roofs huh?

173
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,680
Get down from there, now!

174
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,880
That's just what you want isn't it?

175
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,340
For me to fall on my head.

176
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,820
What I want is for you to climb down!

177
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,160
What you want is for me to have no fun at all.

178
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,280
Fine! Stay up on the roof all night if you want!

179
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,220
Yeah I will!

180
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
What an idiot he is.

181
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,500
Every year this happens. Every year.

182
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,240
At least he's not trying to run a Brave Trail.

183
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,340
She can't tell me what to do.
I'll climb so far up she can't see me.

184
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,080
Wasn't drunk when I ran the Proving!

185
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,260
Might've won.

186
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,320
[in the distance]
Listen carefully now…

187
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,980
[in the distance]
…for you'll have to tell this when I'm gone.

188
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,780
[in the distance]
In the beginning all life came from All-Mother.

189
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,240
People, machines, and beasts.

190
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,320
All were Her children.

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,320
They lived alongside each other in
the comfort of Her wild embrace.

192
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,220
But some grew restless.

193
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,840
Though they took of Her bounty, they wanted more.

194
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,440
These were the Faithless.

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,960
The machines had whispered to them.

196
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,300
Promised to serve them.

197
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,560
To make them a new world,
better than the one All-Mother provided.

198
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,820
A world of metal.

199
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,720
They told the Faithless they would do all the work for them.

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,220
Feed them, shelter them, give them a life of ease.

201
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,520
Of plenty.

202
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,540
And so the Faithless left with the machines.

203
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,180
Only the true children,

204
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,660
the mothers and fathers of the Nora,

205
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,340
stayed with All-Mother.

206
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,540
At first, the machines did as they had promised.

207
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,600
They built cities, great and terrible.

208
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,100
Monuments to their sins.

209
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,520
But they would not serve the Faithless for long.

210
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,260
A king rose up among the machines.

211
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,460
A machine more powerful than any other.

212
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,620
The Metal Devil.

213
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,100
And then the Faithless served him.

214
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,780
Served the machines.

215
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,200
That was not enough for the Metal Devil.

216
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,160
He wanted all to serve him.

217
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,460
And tried to tempt the true children away from All-Mother.

218
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,260
They would not go.

219
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,780
They gathered on the mountainside to cling to Her,

220
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,420
and prayed more devoted than ever.

221
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,240
The Metal Devil raged louder than thunder.

222
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,660
In his fury, he came to confront All-Mother.

223
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,260
Intending to kill Her.

224
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,700
She struck him down.

225
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,100
Forever.

226
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,320
As you know, for his lifeless body is up there still.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,360
Frozen in shame and defeat.

228
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,500
The machines were driven mad by the death of their king.

229
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,940
And their minds became as wild as beasts.

230
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,860
The Faithless abandoned their cities.

231
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,780
Forced to wander the world without the care of the machines.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,640
Only we remain the true children of All-Mother.

233
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,820
We built all this with the hands that She gave us.

234
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,800
Machines are to be hunted.

235
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,920
Metal to be used for scrap, for craft.

236
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,040
But never to be adored.

237
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,780
And we stay true to H er laws,
resolute in our prayers, don't we?

238
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,680
For the dangers are never over.

239
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,400
Still the Faithless envy our Sacred Land and covet it.

240
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
And year upon year the machines anger grows.

241
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,100
Searching for little Nora boys and girls who have not behaved.

242
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,320
[gasp] What? Is that a machine among us now?

243
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,760
No, no. These old eyes are mistaken.

244
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,720
[crowd member]
Bast's a bully. He won't last a minute against Vala.

245
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
[crowd member]
Not in a real fight.

246
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,080
[in the distance]
Aloy! Over here!

247
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,500
Karst?

248
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,940
What are you doing here?

249
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,880
Careful. Pretend like we've never met.

250
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,800
I wasn't supposed to trade with outcasts
in the wilds, remember?

251
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,820
How could I forget?

252
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,860
And how generous of you to talk to me now.

253
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,540
Don't be like that.

254
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,840
You know I'll be rooting for you in the Proving tomorrow.

255
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,240
Can't wait to see the looks
on some of these faces when you win.

256
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,760
And if you need any last minute supplies I'm your man.

257
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,440
So, Mother's Heart.

258
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,100
I thought you preferred the wilds.

259
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,580
Well, a man can't drink alone all the time can he?

260
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Truth is I get lonely once in a while.

261
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
There. I admitted it.

262
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Don't think less of me.

263
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,820
I won't hold it against you if you give me a discount.

264
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,580
You can't be…

265
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm joking Karst.

266
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,660
It's good to see you.

267
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,020
Don't go soft on me.

268
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,060
Alright, let's do this.

269
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,500
Until next time.

270
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,340
Next time you'll be a Brave.

271
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,040
[gong rings]

272
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,540
In a moment, we shall bless the Proving.

273
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,260
But first…

274
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,360
…we have guests to welcome.

275
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,760
For two years we have been at peace with the Carja.

276
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,900
It is time to restore our bonds of trade with Meridian.

277
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,200
These envoys come to us under a banner of peace.

278
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,340
An annunciation of gratitude written…

279
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,620
[crowd]
Killers and slavers!

280
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,080
[crowd]
Yeah! Killers and slavers!

281
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,320
Hey! Hey! Hold your fruit!

282
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,640
Nora … Nora faithful, hold your fruit.

283
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,060
Now I'm Oseram, not Carja.

284
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,360
So I'll put it to you straight.

285
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,300
The thirtheenth Sun King
was a murderous bum.

286
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
He was!

287
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,660
He was a tyrant and a monster…

288
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,060
Raided my tribe for blood sacrifice just like yours.

289
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,300
My own sister was taken.

290
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,500
I hated the Carja.

291
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,620
But the thirteenth King is dead.

292
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,980
Two years now.

293
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,880
And who killed him? The fourteenth.

294
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,080
Not because he lusted for power.

295
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,620
But because someone had to put an end
to his father's atrocities.

296
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,760
Yeah!

297
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,240
The message that this poor priest
means to read is an apology.

298
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,020
Straight from the lips of the fourteenth King.

299
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,040
So please…

300
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
…can't you lend him your ears?

301
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,800
Thank you.

302
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,300
An annunciation of gratitude written
by the hand of Sun-King Avad.

303
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,280
Fourteenth Luminance of the Radiant Line.

304
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,000
Looks like it's on that bald man.

305
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,980
One of the visitors.

306
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,100
"Unknown device detected"?
What does that mean?

307
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
He's wearing a Focus. Just like mine.

308
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,960
You're the only other person I've ever seen
wearing a Focus.

309
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
Where did you get yours?

310
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,500
What? A Nora wearing one of these?

311
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,980
That's impossible.

312
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
Your tribe fears the old places, forbids them!

313
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,900
Who says I'm like other Nora?

314
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,100
Why yeah, I guess you're not if you've gone
delving in the ruins of the Metal World.

315
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,120
Olin!

316
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,760
You making friends with the locals are we?

317
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,480
Aah!

318
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,500
What's wrong?

319
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,020
Apologies. Uhh … a malfunction. I'll come back.

320
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,440
Wait!

321
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,440
No, we'll talk later. Have to go.

322
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,120
Whoa. I guess he's more hungover than I thought.

323
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,960
Hey.

324
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,100
You've got the same trinket that Olin has on his head.

325
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,820
Since when did those become fashionable?

326
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,140
His name is Olin?

327
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
Who is he?

328
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,440
And where did he get one of these?

329
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,080
He's just a scrounger with friends in high places.

330
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,400
He spends half his time digging for artifacts,
the other half drinking or dicing.

331
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,400
As for the trinket, I guess he dug it up somewhere.

332
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,600
Just a weird old jewel he sticks on his face.

333
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,060
No offence.

334
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,520
It looks great on you.

335
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,940
What else do you know about Olin?

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,900
Is he really that interesting?
I'm starting to get jealous.

337
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,080
Well he scours the wilds for ruins.

338
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,660
Digs up stuff and sells it to nobles.

339
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,180
When he's not scrounging, he's scouting.

340
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,480
Exactly the skills you want the man
guarding your expedition to have.

341
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I've known him for a few years.

342
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,840
He's a loyal companion, cares for his family,
and holds his drink well enough.

343
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,760
I like him, but besides that not much to tell.

344
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,120
I've never seen armour like yours before.

345
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,060
You've never seen Vanguard steel?

346
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Let me introduce you.

347
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Ring-locked, impact protected,
sturdy enough to choke a Sawtooth.

348
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
It has to be.

349
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,380
The Vanguard are the Sun-King's best.

350
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
Life takers and machine breakers to a one.

351
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,200
Might even give a Nora Warmaid like you
more trouble than she can handle.

352
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,260
[laugh] With all that metal to slow you down?

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,200
I doubt it.

354
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,900
Yeah, hard to say.

355
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,500
From where I'm standing looks like a pretty even match.

356
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,360
I thought your friend was gonna
go down in a hail of fruit…

357
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
…but you really calmed the crowd.

358
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Thanks. I wasn't sure I could do it.

359
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,780
The Nora are still pissed with the Carja about the Red Raids.

360
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,240
And who can blame them?

361
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,980
I never heard anything about Red Raids growing up.

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,120
What were those?

363
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,820
Your tribe was at war and you didn't even know?

364
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,620
Were you kept hidden away?

365
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,280
Did you have over-protective parents or something?

366
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,980
I grew up as an Outcast.

367
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,220
Shunned by the tribe.

368
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,140
Oh. I've heard the Nora do that.

369
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,260
Seems cruel if you ask me.

370
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,920
But even an Outcast knows about
the Derangement of the Machines right?

371
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,200
How they get deadlier every year?

372
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,660
First I've heard of it.

373
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,780
Oh. Sorry I just assumed everyone knew.

374
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,000
The way I hear it fifteen, twenty, years ago

375
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,940
the machines weren't always pissed off
like they are now.

376
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,360
When a Hunter came at them they'd spook and run.

377
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,780
So it was hard to take them down
but not dangerous.

378
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,880
So long as you were smart enough
to jump out of the way.

379
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,120
But then the Derangement starts up
and everything changes.

380
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,360
Now when a Hunter fires a shot
the machines snarl and charge right at him.

381
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,420
Few more years pass,
and they start attacking people on sight.

382
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,760
Going anywhere becomes a major risk.

383
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,580
If that wasn't bad enough,
entirely new kinds of machines start showing up.

384
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,120
Bigger, meaner, and heavily armed.

385
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,840
Like the Sawtooth?

386
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,340
Yeah, ten years ago that one.

387
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,580
But every couple of years or so
something worse comes along.

388
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,900
Belive me.

389
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,020
So what's making it happen?

390
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,480
No-one knows.

391
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,820
The Mad Sun-King figured if he spilled enough blood
to the Sun-God it would calm the machines.

392
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Didn't work.

393
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,120
But for years he raided the tribes
and took captives for sacrifice.

394
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,100
My sister among them.

395
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,900
Your sister was taken captive and sacrificed?
That's terrible.

396
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,820
Ha! Captive, yes. Sacrificed? No.

397
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,500
It takes more than a few Carja to finish Ersa.

398
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,980
She got away and now she's my captain.

399
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,300
Captain of the entire Vanguard.

400
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,660
Favoured by the Sun-King himself.

401
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,380
How did she survive?

402
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,360
Well that's a story alright.
But it takes a while to tell.

403
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,340
Maybe another time over a drink or three?

404
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,280
Or just come to Meridian and meet her yourself.

405
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,840
I think you'd like each other,
you're both rather … ah … direct.

406
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,700
So what happened? How did it all end?

407
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,240
The Mad King's own son united
Carja rebels with Oseram Freebooters.

408
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,300
Together we did the impossible.

409
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,080
Took back Meridian and killed the crazy old king.

410
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,080
Who are the Oseram?

411
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,100
That's my tribe.

412
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,620
Far to the North-West.

413
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,280
We're good at three things.

414
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,100
Arguing, working steel, and brewing.

415
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,920
And "Freebooters"? What are those?

416
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,760
I guess you could say we were mercenaries.

417
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,240
You know, warriors for pay.

418
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
Except a lot more loyal than that makes us sound.

419
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,760
Avad couldn't have taken down his father
without our metal and muscle.

420
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,540
And now some of us serve proudly
as his personal Vanguard.

421
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,360
If the Carja have such a cruel history
how did you end up serving them?

422
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,300
The last king and his men were butchers.

423
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,720
But the new king wants peace.

424
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,580
There's nothing cruel about that.

425
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Under Avad there's no more sacrifices,
no more slavery.

426
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,420
Besides, the Carja don't just fight, they build.

427
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,920
Take Meridian.

428
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,680
Next to it, everything else
is just a bunch of sticks and stones.

429
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,340
What's it like?

430
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,460
Where do I even start?

431
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,660
My tribesmen are masters of the forge.
The best tinkers in the world.

432
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,200
But when it comes to building,
the Carja have us beat.

433
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,720
The city soars over a canyon with more bridges than the Nora have roads and buildings tall as mountains.

434
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
And across the valley stands the Spire.

435
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,440
Like a blade thrust into the sky,
reflecting the sun.

436
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,940
You really owe it to yourself to see it.

437
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
So consider that a challenge.

438
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,220
Or an invitation.

439
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,080
I should make my way to the Blessing.

440
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,960
Yeah. Look, maybe I shouldn't say this, but…

441
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,560
…it's obvious that you don't belong in this backwater.

442
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
I mean, you're smart, you're obviously capable and…

443
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,500
Well, I mean, look at you.

444
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,740
Err, what are you talking about?

445
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,360
You know what!

446
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,240
Alright, if you ever visit Meridian look me up.

447
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,680
I'll show you around, make introductions.

448
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,900
It'd be a whole new life. If you want it.

449
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,320
Anyway, I have to go to that Blessing thing too.

450
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,000
See you around? Maybe?

451
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,360
[in the distance]
We'll start the Blessing when all aspirants are in place.

452
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,520
Oh!

453
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,580
Expecting more tomatoes?

454
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,860
In truth I thought they were throwing stones.

455
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,980
Stones hit a lot harder,
you'd know the difference.

456
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,180
If you wish to speak,
we should do so after the ceremony.

457
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
I'd rather not hold things up.

458
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Or do anything else that angers these people.

459
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
Let's talk after the Blessing.

460
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't want to piss off the Matriarchs.

461
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,600
Those are some tough looking grandmothers.

462
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,860
Aloy, take your place right there.

463
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,260
The prayer lantern is yours.

464
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
I made it for you.

465
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,520
Blaspemy.

466
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,200
Sisters.

467
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,720
Aspirants! Before each of you sits a prayer lantern
crafted by your mother.

468
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,220
In her honour, light its flame.

469
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,540
In honour of Rost.

470
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,200
And all he did to help me get here.

471
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,580
[Matriarchs together]
All-Mother! Hear our prayer!

472
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,480
[Matriarchs together]
What is the child but a mother's hope that takes flight?

473
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,380
[Matriarchs together]
A glowing flame that climbs the air.

474
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,500
[Matriarchs together]
Set free to the wind, sailing the sky.

475
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,100
[Matriarchs together]
Until it fades and falls.

476
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,680
[Matriarchs together]
So from one to another, passes the chain of love.

477
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,340
There's Olin. I have some questions for him.

478
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,860
Aloy.

479
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,740
Now that the Blessing has been made,
you and I finally have a moment to speak.

480
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,060
I hope the ceremony wasn't
too unpleasant for you.

481
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,440
Given your circumstances.

482
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,680
I can't say it was comfortable,

483
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,560
but I could see the beauty
of the ritual even so.

484
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,000
It takes a generous heart, Aloy,

485
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,160
to commend a ritual that venerates
all that you were denied.

486
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,920
All I'm saying is that it didn't bother me.

487
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,840
I have bigger things to worry about
than hearing the Nora mumble about their mothers.

488
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,940
I see.

489
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,620
Rost told me that Matriarchs don't just lead the tribe.

490
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,080
What else do you do?

491
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,840
We teach. Offer counsel.

492
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,500
Give blessings.

493
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,620
When necessary, we judge.

494
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,840
Our only concern is the welfare of the tribe.

495
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,540
Among our number this year
we count three High Matriarchs,

496
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,680
and some thirty lesser Matriarchs.

497
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
What's the difference?

498
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,880
Matriarchs are grandmothers,
with two generations of living progeny.

499
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
But a High Matriarch is a great-grandmother.

500
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,180
With three or more generations to her name.

501
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,700
Thus do we speak for generations,
lending our opinions weight.

502
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,200
The High Matriarchs most of all.

503
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,200
So the more children you have
the more authority you get?

504
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,420
I guess that's one way to decide who leads a tribe.

505
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,340
Why would there be any other?

506
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,680
Just so you know, Teersa,
the reason I'm here is to get answers.

507
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,020
Real ones.
And when I win the Proving Iwill demand them.

508
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,060
I know, Aloy. I would expect nothing less.

509
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,060
Why was I made an Outcast at birth, Teersa?

510
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,480
What crime could I have committed even before I was born?

511
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,400
Aloy! This is not a question I can answer.

512
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,140
Why not? It's simple enough.

513
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,420
And what about my mother?

514
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,920
Is she here tonight watching me?
Or is she dead?

515
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,100
I am sure your mother is here with us.
If only in spirit.

516
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,000
That's not really an answer, is it?

517
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,300
What about Rost?
Why was he made an Outcast?

518
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,660
So he never told you?

519
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,580
He said he swore an oath never to speak of it.

520
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,020
Yes. As did I.

521
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,880
And the other Matriarchs.

522
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,860
I'm sorry, Aloy. But Rost's past
is another secret I must keep from you.

523
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,440
It's surprises me the tribe lets outcasts run in the Proving.

524
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,660
It's not like the Nora to be so hospitable.

525
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,940
It has alwys been law that any child outcast has this right.

526
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,860
As a means to rejoin the tribe.

527
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,620
So far as I know, however,
you are the first ever to exercise this right.

528
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm not surprised.

529
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,920
I doubt many outcast children survive
long enough in the wilds to come of age.

530
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,520
I think rather it is because child outcasts are so rare.

531
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,820
In all my years I've only known
of one other child who was cast out.

532
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,220
A boy of thirteen.

533
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,740
Who killed his mother.

534
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,040
But at the Proving five years later,
he did not appear.

535
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,620
No.

536
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,400
I'd be surprised if he survived very long on his own.

537
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,580
But at least he had a chance.

538
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,360
Other tribes would've simply executed him.

539
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,640
It may be hard for you to accept, Aloy.

540
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:30,320
But the practice of shunning is,
relatively speaking, humane.

541
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,340
Oh is it?

542
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,700
Try it out for eighteen years Teersa,
and then let me know what you think.

543
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,820
You're not the only one
who's waited years for this day.

544
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,780
I will be praying for your success.

545
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,200
That blessing wasn't so bad.

546
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,540
Nice and short anyway.

547
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,180
But I know a half-dozen Oseram tinkers
who could put on a better fireworks show.

548
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,180
Oops

549
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,020
I hope I'm not throwing a wet blanket
on your sacred ritual.

550
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,860
It was nice.

551
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,200
Really.

552
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,260
Good luck in that Proving thing.

553
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,980
Maybe I'll see you in Meridian some day,
who knows?

554
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,660
You have already been blessed, but…

555
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,040
May the dawn find you,

556
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,540
the day warm you,

557
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,240
and the dusk have light to guide your path.

558
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,480
Who are you Sun Priest?

559
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,560
I am the Reverend Irid.

560
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,800
The glory of the Carja is the Sun's glory reflected.

561
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,020
We Sun Priests are but glimmers of its great light.

562
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,420
You just said a lot,
but you didn't tell me anything.

563
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,920
My apologies.

564
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,520
My duty is to carry out the will of the Sun,

565
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,640
by serving its emissary among us the Sun-King.

566
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,060
I comfort those who walk by the light of day.

567
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,360
And I travel to those in far reaches
whom the light barely touches, bearing warmth.

568
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,720
But here among you I see
a beauty that shines true.

569
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,180
Perhaps Namman is right after all.

570
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,640
That the Sun's light brightens
all lands, and all peoples.

571
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,620
Who's Namman?

572
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,380
One of my bretheren.

573
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,240
Who believes that the sky is wide enough
for the faiths of all tribes.

574
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,900
But you don't believe in All-Mother do you?

575
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,720
Usually the distance between our tribes shrouds Nora ways from Carja eyes.

576
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,440
So you live in Meridian?

577
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,140
I do. Where better to mark the Sun's divine passage

578
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,960
than where the sandstone glows
in the light of its passing?

579
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,960
I was raised in the mesa's great shade.

580
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,380
Its wild bird markets and metal sellers,

581
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,600
spices, and coloured silks!

582
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,940
Sounds impressive.

583
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,780
Oh you should behold it.
And you can if you make the journey.

584
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,220
At His Luminance's order we have
flung its gates open to all!

585
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Did you come all this way just to deliver your Sun-King's speech?

586
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,060
It is my duty. And also my honour.

587
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,360
To carry the light of atonement to those
we overshadowed and wronged.

588
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,220
Under the thirteenth Sun-King
the Carja had no peace with any tribe.

589
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,380
His Luminance has sent those days to dusk.

590
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,120
We must renew the light that binds us.

591
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,440
Though few volunteered to come here.

592
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,120
The Nora scare you?

593
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,240
They're good at making people feel unwelcome.

594
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,000
It's said one soldier died for every Nora taken alive.

595
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,100
Who is the Sun-King you speak for?

596
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,860
His Luminance Avad is the
fourteenth king of the Radiant Line.

597
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,840
His light envelops the sky and everything beneath it.

598
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,020
He is the chosen of the Sun.

599
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,300
By his divine rule we are given sight and purpose.

600
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,000
You speak highly of him.

601
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,420
Do you know him well?

602
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,300
By his nature he is unknowable and infallible.

603
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,600
He's the Sun, he has total power, and no friends.

604
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,860
That couldn't go wrong.

605
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,000
We are his instruments, not his companions.

606
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,600
I have been in his presence,

607
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,440
but we draw down our hoods
so as not to behold his light directly.

608
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,820
If your Sun-Kings are so infallible
how do you explain the crimes of the last king?

609
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:19,360
Uh, well, the Sun's glory is a great and brazen crown
for a vessel as small as a man.

610
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,580
If the vessel is flawed…

611
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,960
Indeed in the burial caves one can see
the skulls of the past kings are cracked.

612
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,480
Trialled and fired in the Sun's kiln.

613
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,760
That can be too much for any man to bear.

614
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,480
Even a ruler of men.

615
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,580
So the Sun can make bad choices like anyone else?

616
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,680
Oh! No, no, no.

617
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,400
Has there ever been a Sun-Queen?

618
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,920
Err, many wives and consorts of course.

619
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,500
Or … oh! You mean for the Sun to choose a queen.

620
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,840
Ah ho ho, this has not happened.

621
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,580
I don't know if you've noticed
but women run things around here.

622
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,500
Well…

623
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,000
Avad took a woman as captain of his Vanguard.

624
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,340
The first to hold such an honour.

625
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
You mean Erend's sister, Ersa?

626
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,080
From what he told me she sounds formidable.

627
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh! Formidable indeed!

628
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,460
A woman and an outsider as well.

629
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,480
She might make a fine Sun-Queen?
Given a chance?

630
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,780
A Sun-Qu– ho ho ho, oh no no no.
No.

631
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,860
Why not?

632
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,020
Er, the Sun is masculine of course.

633
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,140
And so would choose its heirs thus.

634
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,760
Um.It's a light in the sky.

635
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,580
I've never seen anything dangling from it.

636
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,920
This has been … illuminating?

637
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,600
But I should get going.

638
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,740
Hello Olin.

639
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,940
You know my name?

640
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,620
Ah. Guess Erend told you.

641
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,280
Why did you act so strange when we spoke earlier?

642
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,060
Must be this festival.

643
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm really not one for crowds.

644
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,440
Maybe I should just turn in.

645
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,220
Stop dodging my questions.

646
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,580
Alright. Cool your fire.

647
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,320
I got nothing to hide.

648
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,980
What are you doing here, Olin?

649
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,520
Why come to Nora land?

650
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,800
Erend needed a scout for his expedition.

651
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,380
And a second for his drinking.

652
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,180
That's all.

653
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,840
Someone to stop the Sun Priest getting lost.

654
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,180
When all this is over, I'm back to delving ruins.

655
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,800
Rummaging for scrap.

656
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,060
Scrounging up trinkets to sell.

657
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,880
So you're an explorer?

658
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,760
Just another outlander, girl.

659
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,880
A man's got to make his shards.

660
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,660
I just make mine in service to the king's court.

661
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,020
That's all.

662
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,420
I've never seen anyone else with a Focus.

663
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,320
Where exactly did you find it?

664
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,700
In a ruin, north of the Claim.

665
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,460
That's our name for the Oseram homeland.

666
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,180
Up there the metal seams run deep.

667
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,580
Steel giants half buried in loose soil.

668
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,920
Forgotten caves that the Old Ones
bored into mountain rock.

669
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,580
Your face just lit up?

670
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,680
I found my Focus in a cave
just like you're describing.

671
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,200
A ruin of the Old Ones.

672
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
If you've delved yourself, you know as much as I do.

673
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,780
Go to those places for answers, not me.

674
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,500
When we spoke earlier, you winced,
then looked like you were in pain.

675
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,060
Or frightened.

676
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,340
Did your Focus show you something?

677
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,840
It didn't show me anything.

678
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,940
I told you, it malfunctioned.

679
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,300
Happens all the time.

680
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,560
You're not a very convincing liar.

681
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Do you always accuse people you've just met of lying?

682
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,580
Only the ones who aren't telling the truth.

683
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,220
Fire and spit, girl!

684
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm a plain hammered man with nothing to hide.

685
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,280
You don't believe me, that's your trouble not mine.

686
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,120
I don't understand.

687
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,140
We have this device in common,
but you can't wait to stop talking to me.

688
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,840
[sighs]

689
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,120
I already have all the friends I need, girl.

690
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,640
I don't need the bother.

691
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,620
I'm used to being shunned by the tribe.

692
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,080
I thought you'd be different.

693
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,700
It's nothing personal.

694
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,480
It really isn't.

695
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,740
You should…

696
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,520
…try to enjoy yourself tonight.

697
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,140
Big day tomorrow.

698
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
Always best to make every day count.

699
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:42,000
[constant drumming]

700
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,380
Motherless chuff.

701
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,680
What did you say?

702
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,160
Find your bed, outcast,
and dream of winning the Proving.

703
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,740
That's the closest you're gonna get.

704
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,860
Oh. Is this the bedhouse?

705
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,640
With you standing guard,
I figured it was the latrine.

706
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,340
Your very presence here… uh.

707
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,560
Well, well. Look who's come in from the wild.

708
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,740
The motherless outcast.

709
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,440
You can be a real lard sometimes Bast.
Cut it out.

710
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,260
You didn't know the words to the Blessing did you?

711
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,660
But no-one heards your prayers anyway.

712
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,460
Aww, you even try to dress like a real Nora.

713
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,420
Not that it fools anyone.

714
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,600
So this is how it's gonna be with you is it?

715
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,840
This is how it's gonna be with everyone, outcast.

716
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,640
You belong in the wilds, not in Mother's Heart.

717
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,520
And you definitely don't belong in the Proving.

718
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,800
You can sense it.

719
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,440
You already know you're going to lose.

720
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,940
Hah! I've trained all my life for the Proving.

721
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,360
I'm not afraid of you, I'm not afraid of anything!

722
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,320
Really?

723
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,000
Confidence is quiet, you're not.

724
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,700
You know I often think of the day I gave you that scar.

725
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,460
It's a cherished memory.

726
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah.

727
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,260
The look on your face
when I knocked that stone out of your hand

728
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,920
was pretty entertaining.
But I suppose you leave

729
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,080
that part of the story out when you tell it,
don't you?

730
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,940
I branded you that day to mark your shame.

731
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,720
All you did that day was make me stronger.

732
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,260
Just wait.

733
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,880
I'll show you tomorrow.

734
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,780
Hah! Yeah, right.

735
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,740
This is boring.
Time for Bast to get some sleep.

736
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,020
You'll be the one surprised tomorrow, outcast, not me.

737
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,640
Oh are you going to shut your mouth?
Because that would be a surprise!

738
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,120
Nice job handling Bast.

739
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,840
That should keep him quiet…

740
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,580
'til morning anyway.

741
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,380
I don't believe we've met. I'm Aloy.

742
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,240
Oh I know who you are.

743
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,380
The competition.

744
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,820
The others they'll finish the Proving.

745
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,800
Most of them.

746
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,280
But win it?
That's down to Bast, you, or me.

747
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,780
Vala.

748
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,560
Nice to meet you, Vala.

749
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,160
You're right. I am going to win tomorrow.

750
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,000
Never celebrate a victory before it's earned, girl.

751
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,440
My mother taught me that.

752
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,820
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to get some sleep.

753
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,440
I plan to be well rested
when I run you into the ground tomorrow.

754
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,560
[laughs]

755
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,100
Your bunk's right there, when you want it.

756
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,980
Okay. Thanks.

757
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,160
So, your first day in Mother's Heart.

758
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,380
What do you think?

759
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,140
You've never slept in a Nora lodge before.

760
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,960
Not very private.

761
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,380
Comforts and distractions, that's what I think.

762
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,480
Not all comforts are bad.

763
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,800
Comforts are weakness.

764
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
You sound just like my mother.

765
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,820
It has … certain charms.

766
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,920
Homey enough once you're accepted.

767
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,540
That's the problem.

768
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,340
I think you'll find a place here.

769
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,260
I do. Get some rest.

770
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,380
Braves! Ready yourselves!

771
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,840
What will it take to get you out of here?

772
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,460
Grazers!

773
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,220
Your trophy is shattered, outcast!

774
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,160
Looks like you'll need another.

775
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,920
Faster, come on!

776
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,640
I've gotta catch up!

777
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,440
I've gotta catch up!

778
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,360
[in the distance]
Slow and steady now!

779
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,040
[in the distance]
All you need is to finish.

780
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,960
[in the distance]
That makes all but one.

781
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,980
[in the distance]
Is the outcast coming?

782
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,600
[in the distance]
She was behind me!

783
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,180
Dead last, girl.
Might as well walk from here.

784
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,540
Bast will win, or Vala.

785
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,220
But you'll be made a Brave so long as you finish.

786
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,940
Ooh now, that's an old trail.

787
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,480
Two died on it last year.

788
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,180
It's falling apart.

789
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,360
Better dead last than dead altogether.

790
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

791
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,660
By All-Mother, are you crazy?

792
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,420
You're gonna kill yourself!

793
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,120
It doesn't get any easier!

794
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,220
You're insane to go that way!

795
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,480
No way but forward now.

796
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,620
[in the distance]
Who's in the lead?

797
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,340
[in the distance]
I can't see.

798
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,440
[in the distance]
Bast. Or Vala.

799
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,440
Come on now!

800
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,720
Faster! Stop dragging!

801
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,120
Gotta keep going!

802
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,000
[in the distance]
The outcast!

803
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,240
[in the distance]
On the old trail?

804
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,340
[in the distance]
Is she crazy?

805
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,820
Good, I'm gaining!

806
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,020
[in the distance]
Look! The outcast is catching up!

807
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,060
[in the distance]
How'd she get up there?

808
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,180
Made it!

809
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,400
Come on now, hurry!

810
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,820
Keep at it!

811
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,000
I've trained my whole life for this.

812
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,040
They had a tribe, but I had the wilds.

813
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,200
Precision, not enough.

814
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,620
Must be perfect!

815
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,800
Come on, come on! You can make it!

816
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,460
Can't let them beat me now!

817
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,640
She didn't win! The outcast cheated!

818
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,900
An outcast win the Proving?

819
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,200
Never.

820
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,300
For she is a Brave now.

821
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,100
You did it!

822
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,520
As are you all, so long as
you put your trophy on the altar.

823
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,760
But it is Aloy,

824
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,780
once outcast, and now Brave,

825
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,520
who is first among…

826
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,640
AAH!

827
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,040
Uh!

828
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,240
Aah!

829
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,700
Aah!

830
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:15,640
Aaaaa!

831
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,900
Aloy! Come!

832
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,540
Keep them pinned down until the others arrive.

833
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,660
Aaaah!

834
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,680
We can't stay here! That's the way out.

835
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,060
But we won't make it under fire.

836
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,520
They can't shoot if they're dead!

837
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,020
Keep them busy!

838
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,340
I'll find an angle.

839
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,880
Bast! BAST! Are you with us?

840
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,120
I'm with you!

841
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,780
Let's go!

842
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,540
Now!

843
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,120
[in the distance]
Too many of them!

844
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,340
[in the distance]
We can't win!

845
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,480
[in the distance]
We can't hold them!

846
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,740
[in the distance]
All-Mother help us!

847
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,700
[in the distance]
Kill the invaders!

848
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,700
[in the distance]
Kill the defilers!

849
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,440
[in the distance]
They're too strong!

850
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,840
[in the distance]
We can't stop them!

851
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,880
Quick! Run for the slip wire!

852
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,640
Kill them all.
No witnesses, no survivors.

853
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,420
[in the distance]
For All-Mother!

854
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,740
[in the distance]
Oh no! There's more!

855
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,960
[in the distance]
They keep coming! How many are there?

856
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,340
Up on the ridge, there's more of them!

857
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,740
[in the distance]
Too many of them!

858
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,020
This is it for you.

859
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,840
[in the distance]
We can't hold them!

860
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,340
[in the distance]
All-Mother help us!

861
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,120
Here!

862
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,080
[in the distance]
Kill the defilers!

863
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,640
Now, descend while we have a chance!

864
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,120
Aaah!

865
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,840
Vala! Vala!

866
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,380
No! Urk!

867
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,780
The red hair dies now!
Everyone forward!

868
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,180
Oof!

869
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,400
Turn your face to the sun, child.

870
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,640
NO!

871
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,500
Burn it all. Then to your task.

872
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,700
As you command.

873
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,660
Aloy!

874
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:07,720
Aloy.

875
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,080
Survive!
