1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,467
NALTUK: Perhaps Ourea should meet you after all.

2
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,750
NALTUK: What she truly seeks is hope.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,850
After what I just saw, you could show her that.

4
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,369
She's in retreat beyond those mountains, the Icerasps.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,335
You'll have to walk the Shaman's Path to get there.

6
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:42,090
Follow the markers through the ice caves
and the waterfalls, and make the climb to the shrine.

7
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,750
But be careful.

8
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,676
The path is meant to be an ordeal.

9
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,983
The final trial of a young Shaman's training.

10
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,879
And I'll find Ourea at the end of it?

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,349
No, she goes further up, somewhere inside the mountain.

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,500
You'll know you've reached the end when you come to a shrine,
a great machine covered in bluegleam.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,890
Shamans who complete the path take a piece of it as reward.

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,470
If you make it that far, you should too. You'll have earned it.

15
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,790
I'm pretty far up. The Shaman's Path must be around here somewhere.

16
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,399
This must be one of the markers Naltuk told me about.

17
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,680
Looks like each marker points to another, giving directions.

18
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,850
Wrong way.

19
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:23,159
Guess I'm heading deeper into the cold, creepy ice cave.

20
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,930
This isn't the way out. Some gear, though.

21
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,850
What's this chime for?

22
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,269
To help guide the way with sound?

23
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,236
If there's more maybe my Focus could find them.

24
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,132
Yup, Focus can pick up the chimes. Should help me find my way.

25
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,538
Another marker, good.

26
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,350
This isn't the way out. Some gear, though.

27
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,610
Okay, that way then.

28
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,830
I took a wrong turn.

29
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,639
Not this way. Then, where?

30
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,744
Huh, I see, up.

31
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,253
Stalkers, better be careful.

32
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,299
Okay, through here.

33
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,160
Better go back … after I grab this loot.

34
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,650
There we go, hopefully out of this cave.

35
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,442
Done with the cave. So what's next on this path?

36
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,132
How does this bridge work?

37
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,037
It looks like it needs to fill up with water before I can cross.

38
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,069
Around the bend we go.

39
00:21:03,818 --> 00:21:05,480
Now how do I cross this one?

40
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:13,823
Down? Looks like I need to get up to that rope.

41
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,000
Down it is.

42
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,156
There's the way up.

43
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,660
I need to pull the rope to move this thing into position.

44
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,846
Okay, the bridge is filling up.

45
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,264
Made it.

46
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,230
Could forget what warm feels like.

47
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,190
Burgrend wasn't exaggerating.

48
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,586
There's definitely something new out here, and I don't think it's friendly.

49
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,194
Don't like the sound of that.

50
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,930
Got too much already.

51
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,400
Scary new machine, down.

52
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,049
Now back to finding Ourea, which means I gotta climb.

53
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,349
I should be able to get up there.

54
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,678
This must be the shrine Naltuk was talking about.

55
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,956
Guess I should take some bluegleam.

56
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:43,750
Sparkles. I can see why it's worth a lot.

57
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:05,449
Naltuk said Ourea went past the shrine, up into the mountain.

58
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,760
I'd better take those stairs.

59
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,083
An ancient door, maybe Ourea is inside.

60
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,579
RECORDING: March 10th, 2046.

61
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:40,134
RECORDING: I just spent sixteen hours in here.

62
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:44,920
RECORDING: Trying to install upgrades
to improve efficiency for the central processing unit.

63
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,440
RECORDING: Project Firebreak is going to need the brain power.

64
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,829
RECORDING: Let's just hope I'll have enough of my own.

65
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,219
RECORDING: Anita stayed with me the whole time.

66
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,658
RECORDING: We got a lot done.

67
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,127
RECORDING: But every time she brushed by and I smelled her hair…

68
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:02,800
RECORDING: Oh boy, I should just go to bed.

69
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,139
Lots of strange equipment.

70
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:14,849
What was this place?

71
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,230
Locked. Maybe my Focus can help.

72
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,019
Looks like the door was wired to something over here.

73
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,488
RECORDING: This is Director of Security Blevins.

74
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,308
RECORDING: Resending the emergency supply order.

75
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:33,558
RECORDING: Try reading it this time, okay?

76
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,630
RECORDING: You …weasels don't want me calling my people in SLC.

77
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,998
RECORDING: Director of Security Blevins is riding us like a petty tyrant.

78
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,119
RECORDING: I can't even sneeze without triggering his control issues.

79
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,019
Those nodes on the floor must be connected to the door.

80
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,260
Well that did … something.

81
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,000
What am I supposed to do with these lights?

82
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,530
These things turn, changing the flow of light.

83
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,893
Alright, let's see if the door's open.

84
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,219
RECORDING: Another email from my sister.

85
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,719
RECORDING: I haven't got time to think, let alone reply.

86
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,289
RECORDING: Oh, that photo of the girls she sent
didn't do much for my conscience.

87
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:59,219
RECORDING: Jenny looks pretty proud of her pilgrim costume.

88
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,329
RECORDING: Crap, I've never missed Thanksgiving before.

89
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,349
RECORDING: And chances for Christmas? Near zero.

90
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,699
RECORDING: I can't even tell them
that all the work I'm doing is to keep them safe.

91
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:20,568
RECORDING: How am I going to explain to Kenny that Firebreak is doomed,

92
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:26,619
RECORDING: without a guiding intelligence
advanced enough not only to think, but to feel.

93
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:08,789
Fresh air ahead.
