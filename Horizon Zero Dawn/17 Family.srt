1
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,861
The first pilgrim is an Oseram who seeks to visit
the Shrine of Kings on the road to the city.

2
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:33,793
He waits there now, forbidden to enter by an old Sun Priest who'll suffer no heathen.

3
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:40,161
This Utaru lost her companion on the edge of the Jewel
at a pool where Snapmaws gather.

4
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:45,945
And the Banuk would paint a mark on the Sun's Climb,
a call to the machine spirits I understand.

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,300
They need no beckoning.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,820
So, clear the machines out of two shrines and move a priest out of the other.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,460
All I can ask for is your charity and that their stories are heard.

8
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,539
Namman, rituals and prayers can't bring back those who are lost.

9
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,138
No, but it can help those who grieve to find themselves.

10
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,480
It can lend them strength and hope, like a new sunrise.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,890
[Carja artisan]
I swore I'd ask her to marry me on a sunny day. Hope her father says yes.

12
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:38,281
[Carja guard]
If you wander into the outlands south of here,
pray to the Sun you never run into a Thunderjaw called Redmaw.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,991
[Carja artisan]
Oh, that's nice. Glad I stopped for a bit.

14
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,659
[Carja artisan]
I've seen this four times already.

15
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,061
This must be the Shrine of Kings that Namman told me about.

16
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,560
[Oseram worker]
Every time I go near the statue, he shouts at me.

17
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,560
[Oseram worker]
Oseram slaves built that thing. We deserve to have a look.

18
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,570
[Oseram worker]
It may have been meant for the Mad Sun-King, but it's ours.

19
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,360
You won't get in there.

20
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,176
That dried up old prune in a robe sees to that.

21
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,349
I can be persuasive.

22
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,870
But what does an Oseram want with a Carja shrine anyway?

23
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,860
It reminds me of someone,

24
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,270
gone two years now.

25
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,900
But what does a girl like you know of loss?

26
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:15,759
Try me.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
I had a lover,

28
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,750
worked on monuments to their bastard king.

29
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,360
Then he gave them a show in their Sun Ring for good measure.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,948
The Carja gave me back his broken bones.

31
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,759
But what use are they?

32
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,370
They won't build again.

33
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,770
They won't make me smile.

34
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,103
And seeing a statue of the Mad Sun-King will?

35
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:48,270
I need to see his work again.

36
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,761
The marks his hands carved.

37
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,349
The set of the metals they hammered.

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,759
That's the soul of him.

39
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,969
But that shriveled up old priest won't let me near it.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,550
I'll see what I can do.

41
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,638
[Oseram worker]
Every time I go near the statue, he shouts at me!

42
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:23,670
[Oseram worker]
Oseram slaves built that thing. We deserve to have a look.

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,278
[Oseram worker]
It may have been meant for the Mad Sun-King, but its ours now.

44
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:31,370
[Oseram worker]
It's a public monument, not his private shrine.

45
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,170
Turn away, child.

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,069
The Abiding Jahamin wishes to be alone in his retreat.

47
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,838
If you want to be alone, go someplace else.

48
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,467
Others want to pray here.

49
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,050
Defile it, you mean.

50
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,050
Yet another debasement of what was once pure.

51
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,959
Truly, our tribe has lost the light.

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,359
Our king is false.

53
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,979
Our temple is corrupt.

54
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,569
And our soldiers weak.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,769
The Sun hastens across the sky for shame.

56
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,359
So the Carja have become impure?

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,850
What does that even mean?

58
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,759
Is Meridian not meant for those who built it?

59
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,370
Who made it great?

60
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,051
It was pure before outlander squatters took it over.

61
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,739
You mean Meridian was pure when the outsiders
were in cages or dying in your arena?

62
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,670
The Sun is pure, child.

63
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,360
It is not our place to question Its divine will, only to act upon it.

64
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,900
I thought Avad taking the throne was the Sun's will?

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,434
The boy dishonored his father.

66
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,470
Dishonored us all.

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,860
To kill the Sun-King.

68
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,277
What shadow, what twilight time he brought upon us.

69
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:49,539
And how many more would the Mad Sun-King have killed if Avad hadn't stopped him?

70
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,870
The Sun called for blood.

71
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,550
There was no choice but to obey.

72
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,838
Why do you think your army is weak?

73
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,939
Because you're not at war with everyone?

74
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,489
A Carja throne relying on forge-dirt mercenaries? Preposterous!

75
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,439
The so-called liberation was nothing but a purge.

76
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:15,149
Our most blessed warriors chased out of the city,
exiled to Sunfall and the Forbidden West.

77
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,490
Our tribe is torn.

78
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,887
The ones who walked in light now go by shadow.

79
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:25,039
And yet everyone but you seems happy they're gone.

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,689
They call themselves Sun Priests.

81
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,050
But they have no authority, youths and sycophants all.

82
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,420
Yet those who gave their whole lives to the Sun's service are shamed and ignored.

83
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,959
So that's what this is.

84
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,449
A tantrum, a cry for attention?

85
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,334
You know nothing of our rites, and yet you dare to insult me?

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,139
I'm done arguing with you.

87
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,467
Stay or go, but I won't allow you to keep others away.

88
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,370
I am here by the will of the Sun.

89
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,149
If you won't accept change, you should try to make peace with it.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,449
Your bitterness has poisoned you.

91
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,720
I have no need of your pity.

92
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,350
I wasn't offering it.

93
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,199
But if you step aside, you can keep your pride.

94
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,160
Since it's so important to you.

95
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,709
My conviction blazes like the noonday light.

96
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,134
Then stop me from bringing in the Oseram.

97
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:19,350
I… I cannot.

98
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,959
I thought so.

99
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,329
You don't believe in the throne, the priesthood, the army, or the city.

100
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,959
So I guess you have no authority here.

101
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,050
I have the authority of the Sun!

102
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,539
Then call it for help.

103
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,100
No one else will listen.

104
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,990
There'll be a reckoning.

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,730
You'll back away from it.

106
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,299
[Oseram worker]
The wheel turning all day. By the forge, I believe I've earned a drink or two.

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,470
He gave them the best work he'd ever do.

108
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,459
Carja carving is fancy, finicky work.

109
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,649
They've thin fingers, you see.

110
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,860
Not like forge-burned hands. And look at it now.

111
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,060
They defaced it because they hated what it stood for.

112
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,736
They defaced a thing slaves like him lived and died for.

113
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,360
Slaves they've already forgotten.

114
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,269
Short sighted bastards the lot.

115
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,649
If they thought their Sun set off this bridge, they'd jump after it.

116
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,146
I thank you for honouring my wish.

117
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:39,850
I hope you can find peace.

118
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,275
I wouldn't know what to do with it. Any more than the Carja do.

119
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,620
[Oseram worker]
Never bothered me that the Carja talk down to us.

120
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,161
[Oseram worker]
I'm supposed to take someone dressed like that seriously?

121
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,189
[Carja guard]
Watch out for the Oseram merchants.

122
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,470
[Carja outlander]
…I should report it to the Sun Court.

123
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:51,223
The machine saw me.

124
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:20,000
This must be the Sun's Climb where the Banuk wants to paint his mark.

125
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,180
[Banuk]
It's good you did this.

126
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,250
You were a better hunter than I.

127
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,139
I'll paint the mark while the spirits of the Glinthawks linger.

128
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,139
There will be more where they came from.

129
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,549
Yes, there will always be more machines.

130
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,659
Their spirits find new bodies.

131
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,369
But we only last a long as memory.

132
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,338
That's why I must leave the story.

133
00:17:55,339 --> 00:18:00,799
A monument to our vanished Shamans, to the wisdom the Carja bled from us.

134
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,269
The machine oil in the paint will preserve it.

135
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,970
Preserve their memory against all that was cut away.

136
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,029
You have my thanks, hunter.

137
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,680
Looking good.

138
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,690
This is where the Utaru wanted to say her goodbyes.

139
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,819
When we fled from our cages during the liberation
I tore through this clearing thinking my friend was behind me.

140
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:30,160
I kept running, but here she remains.

141
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:34,269
Thank you for making it safe for me to return.

142
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,480
I don't want to rush you, but it won't stay safe for long.

143
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:38,759
I understand.

144
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,934
I've done this before in waking dreams.

145
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:46,069
In the pool I'll find the bracelet of seeds she dropped when she fell.

146
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,600
The seeds will be split, escaped, grown wild.

147
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:53,900
She's passing from my memory into the jungle's.

148
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,729
I'll tell her it was I who died here and became a stranger in our own land.

149
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:05,246
And she who still lives in every time of planting, of rains, harvest… oh!

150
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,500
What is it?

151
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,763
There. Her bracelet.

152
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:15,500
And I thought she was behind me.

153
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,710
But there's only my reflection.

154
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,600
Do you need to be alone?

155
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,892
For the first time I am.

156
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,359
Looks good.

157
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,349
I'll find a use for you.

158
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,470
Keep that for later.

159
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,210
Aloy, you're a woman of your word.

160
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,460
Olin.

161
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,279
Your family.

162
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,299
I saw the threat from Helis.

163
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,534
You have a wife and young boy?

164
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,980
If I'd have striven to keep them safe instead of all I've done.

165
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,889
This is your chance, Olin.

166
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,239
That's why we're here.

167
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,460
I'll take it.

168
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,779
A kinder deal was never struck.

169
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,700
They're being held close by?

170
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,269
Yes, the farmstead just beyond these rocks.

171
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,549
I'll take you.

172
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,322
[Olin]
That's it, nestled against the Spurflints.

173
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,450
[Olin]
Best not to think about the previous owners.

174
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,549
[Aloy]
Too late.

175
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,372
[Olin]
Aloy, down behind this rock.

176
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,000
So this is it.

177
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,426
I can't bear being so close, and yet…

178
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,239
You've been watching for a while.

179
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,608
What's the best way in?

180
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:31,180
You think if I had a head for strategy, either of us would be in this mess?

181
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,059
Fair point.

182
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:36,089
We could storm the front gate, Oseram style.

183
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,139
How many Eclipse are we talking?

184
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,098
From what I've seen a fair few.

185
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,066
Well armed and armoured.

186
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:44,538
Bowmen watching from the ridges.

187
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:47,239
But there's no space for their machine demons.

188
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,739
With the Eclipse, there's always another blade at your back.

189
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,160
So I'll watch yours if you'll let me.

190
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,960
No, you wait here.

191
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,538
Be ready to follow when the fighting stops.

192
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,269
Oh, I'll be ready.

193
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,684
This has to be where they're holding Olin's family.

194
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:18,069
Bolted tight. One of the Eclipse must have the key.

195
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,869
[Eclipse cultist]
To me, brothers!

196
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,599
[Eclipse cultist]
You cannot run from righteousness!

197
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:46,859
[Eclipse cultist]
Where? We were just getting started.

198
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,549
[Eclipse cultist]
Die!

199
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,504
Come on, come on.

200
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,769
We heard the commotion outside.

201
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,550
You're not one of them.

202
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,480
Who are you?

203
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,918
Don't be afraid.

204
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:45,630
I'm going to get you out of here.

205
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,489
I hadn't given up on hope, but I'd forgotten the taste of it.

206
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,369
Is it safe for us to leave?

207
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,659
The Eclipse won't be stopping you.

208
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:57,170
I dreamed of escape, a thousand different ways.

209
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,539
But all of them put my son at risk.

210
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,400
You survived, you protected him, that's what matters.

211
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:08,480
Now, your husband's waiting for you.

212
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,489
Olin!

213
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,239
I heard the fighting stop!

214
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,340
Olin!

215
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,179
You brought him back to us.

216
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,340
Thank you.

217
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,469
There's no need to thank me.

218
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,199
I have much to confess.

219
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:56,128
I accepted a devil's bargain, and others paid the price.

220
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,123
And do you think I don't know?

221
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,150
I heard them talk.

222
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:04,170
You know there's always been dirt on my hands.

223
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,739
Now there's blood too.

224
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,998
Take your son up in those hands.

225
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
Come back to The Claim with us.

226
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,340
You should listen to your wife, Olin.

227
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:17,110
But Helis and his demons…?

228
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,119
I am honour bound to help you, Aloy.

229
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:23,800
With what little honour a dicer like me has.

230
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:24,840
Olin,

231
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,654
whatever your debts, you don't owe them to me now.

232
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:30,369
Go with your family.

233
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,739
Show them you're a better man.

234
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,650
Farewell, Aloy.

235
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,739
Your mother.

236
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,739
I hope you find her before they do.

237
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,280
Here they come.

238
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,599
There's the Tallneck that my Focus picked up.

239
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,789
Have to climb up to the Tallneck's head.

240
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,900
Hello!

241
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:40,409
Deal with him quick.

242
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,079
I think I'm in the clear.

243
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,739
I think I can leap onto the Tallneck from here.

244
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,699
Gotta follow up!

245
00:51:40,284 --> 00:51:43,139
Alright, now I just have to reach its head.

246
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,524
There, got it!

247
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:35,823
Oh, come on.

248
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:39,860
Ah, better.

249
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:42,955
Low and quiet does it.

250
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:40,079
This'll help.
