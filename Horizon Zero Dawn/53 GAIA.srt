1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,449
ELISABET SOBECK: What if we could build a kind of seed
from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew?

2
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:34,000
ELISABET SOBECK: This is the aim, the hope, of Project Zero Dawn.

3
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:42,200
To create a super intelligent, fully automated,
terraforming system and bring life back from lifelessness.

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,549
What would such a system require?

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,450
At its core it would need a true AI fully capable of making
the trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere.

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,855
An immortal guardian devoted to the reflourishing of life.

7
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,990
We call it GAIA.

8
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,929
Mother Nature as an AI.

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,340
ALOY: Eclipse, they're here.

10
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,649
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: Avoid contact!

11
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:19,828
ECLIPSE: Lines look good.

12
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:22,703
ALOY: Gaia!

13
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,873
SYLENS: Can you reach it?

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,597
ALOY: So much for avoiding contact.

15
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:48,249
ECLIPSE: Too close—

16
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:54,765
ECLIPSE: We're under attack!

17
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:56,709
ECLIPSE: I'm looking right at her!

18
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,939
ECLIPSE: You shall perish!

19
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,234
ECLIPSE: Oh no!

20
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,215
ECLIPSE: Stay in cover, stay in shadow!

21
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,699
ECLIPSE: A gift from the Shadow!

22
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,530
ECLIPSE: I will teach you to bleed.

23
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,840
ALOY: That's the last of them.

24
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,010
COMPUTER: Alert, H-Lock structural failure. Repeat—

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,875
ALOY: Ugh, or not.

26
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,367
ECLIPSE: Take cover!

27
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,567
ECLIPSE: Finish this!

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,124
ALOY: Ah, room's clear. For a moment, anyway.

29
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:55,480
SYLENS: Then get moving, you have to find Gaia.

30
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,700
COMPUTER: Alert. Area inaccessible.

31
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,269
COMPUTER: Elevators non-operational, stairwells have collapsed.

32
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,485
Hello, I'm Margo Shĕn and this is Hephaestus.

33
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,182
As the name might tip you off this is going to be the subordinate function
that Gaia will use to make lots and lots of robots.

34
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,409
Her personal forge, except it's not that simple.

35
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,434
MARGO SHĔN: Um, so like you probably noticed
that only about a third of you are robotics engineers.

36
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:41,876
MARGO SHĔN: The rest experts
in machine cognition, virtual heuristics, that stuff.

37
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:46,400
MARGO SHĔN: Well, that's because
we aren't going to be the ones designing and building robots.

38
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:52,434
MARGO SHĔN: The last thing we want is to burden GAIA with a bunch of outmoded twenty-first century designs.

39
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,859
MARGO SHĔN: Waste of time.

40
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,414
MARGO SHĔN: Our purpose is to empower GAIA to build the robots.

41
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:00,945
MARGO SHĔN: And not just build, imagine, from scratch.

42
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:06,634
MARGO SHĔN: Any robot she needs for any conceivable purpose,
designed and fabricated at a snap of a finger.

43
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,167
MARGO SHĔN: Hers, her finger.

44
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,874
MARGO SHĔN: So Hephaestus isn't really the forge.

45
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:19,712
MARGO SHĔN: It's more like the knowledge of craft and ingenuity
of a master smith to wield the hammer, encoded as software.

46
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,375
MARGO SHĔN: Virtual creativity made real.

47
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,810
MARGO SHĔN: Gaia's already learning.

48
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,236
MARGO SHĔN: In simulations she's doing some very creative things
with fractal assembly and animal morphologies.

49
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,611
MARGO SHĔN: Her designs aren't about to win the Li-Em prize anytime soon.

50
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,507
MARGO SHĔN: But hey, everyone has to start somewhere.

51
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:40,000
MARGO SHĔN: So yes, time to get started. Let's do this.

52
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,549
ALOY: I don't get it.

53
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,844
ALOY: If Hephaestus was part of a system
designed to save life, why would it use CYAN to make a Cauldron?

54
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:52,908
ALOY: And churn out machines with no other purpose than to kill people?

55
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:57,860
SYLENS: Somehow it's gone rogue. I don't understand why, or how.

56
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,269
SYLENS: But whatever the reason, it explains
why machines have become more dangerous over the years.

57
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,846
ALOY: I've seen these shapes before, in Cauldrons.

58
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:55,009
SYLENS: But of course. The birthing places of Gaia's machines.

59
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,824
ALOY: I think this is it, Elisabet Sobeck's office.

60
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:15,176
ALOY: But it's sealed off. There's got to be a way inside.

61
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,690
SYLENS: Keep looking.

62
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,889
ALOY: More Eclipse.

63
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,379
SYLENS: Careful now.

64
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:23,740
SAMINA EBADJI: Welcome to Apollo.

65
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:30,149
The collective memory of the human species
and the wellspring of knowledge for future generations.

66
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,279
SAMINA EBADJI: I am Samina Ebadji.

67
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:39,940
SAMINA EBADJI: Until recently I was Director of the International Collective Memory Institute in New Tehran.

68
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:49,274
As a heritage professional, I devoted my career to the preservation of human knowledge, creative endeavour, and cultural achievement.

69
00:16:49,274 --> 00:17:00,330
SAMINA EBADJI: Apollo is therefore the ultimate embodiment of
a lifelong passion, albeit under the very worst circumstances imaginable.

70
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,139
SAMINA EBADJI: The challenges before us are immense.

71
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:11,146
SAMINA EBADJI: Specifically, we will have to design
and implement four major initiatives simultaneously.

72
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:18,670
SAMINA EBADJI: First, the construction of data repositories
in Cradle facilities around the world, ensuring redundancy.

73
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:26,834
SAMINA EBADJI: Second, the collection and processing
of a projected 180 million discreet data entries.

74
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:33,415
SAMINA EBADJI: 42 zettabytes of data in Mandarin, English, Spanish, and Arabic.

75
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:41,745
SAMINA EBADJI: Third, the transferral and encoding
of all that data onto DNA encapsulated in synthetic fossils.

76
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:48,512
SAMINA EBADJI: The only medium capacious and durable enough
to safeguard it without degradation for the centuries to come.

77
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:51,367
SAMINA EBADJI: And last, but not least…

78
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:56,214
SAMINA EBADJI: The development of
the holographic interface and gameified curricula.

79
00:17:56,214 --> 00:18:00,000
SAMINA EBADJI: By which future humans will commune with Apollo.

80
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,807
SAMINA EBADJI: Progressively unlocking heuristic learning modules.

81
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:09,939
SAMINA EBADJI: Levelling up their knowledge,
and skills they will need to take control of the terraforming system.

82
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,089
SAMINA EBADJI: That is the future
towards which all of our efforts will be directed.

83
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:23,189
SAMINA EBADJI: Not just the preservation of the past,
but the seed for the flourishing of a new tree of knowledge.

84
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,710
SAMINA EBADJI: Welcome, and let us begin.

85
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,470
ALOY: Haven't you got anything better to do?

86
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,982
ECLIPSE: I will teach you to bleed.

87
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:42,787
ALOY: I've got other ammo.

88
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:03,820
ECLIPSE: Right here!

89
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:18,049
ALOY: That's the last of them, alone once more.

90
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,858
SYLENS: In what should have been a cave of wonders.

91
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,571
SYLENS: Look around, see if anything is left.

92
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:06,690
GEN. HERRES: Dr. Sobeck, please archive this testimonial in Apollo.

93
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,634
GEN. HERRES: Cross-referenced to
all mentions of my name, and Operation Enduring Victory.

94
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:14,798
GEN. HERRES: My name is General Aaron Herres.

95
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,695
GEN. HERRES: From 2060 to 2066 I served
as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

96
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:24,242
GEN. HERRES: The highest ranked officer of the United States Armed Forces.

97
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:31,938
GEN. HERRES: The tenure of my command included
strategic planning and oversight of Operation Enduring Victory.

98
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:38,367
GEN. HERRES: A falsehood perpetrated on
the civilian populations of the United States and other nations…

99
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,904
GEN. HERRES: …during the last 14 months of life on this planet.

100
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:45,989
GEN. HERRES: Before the Faro plague, I did my job and did it well.

101
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:51,001
GEN. HERRES: I was bold and decisive, crafty in political manoeuvres.

102
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:58,031
GEN. HERRES: It wasn't an accident that I rose to my position
and became the commander of the largest mechanised force ever assembled.

103
00:25:58,031 --> 00:25:59,509
GEN. HERRES: But to what end?

104
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,740
GEN. HERRES: My only lasting achievement was the extinction of life on Earth.

105
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:16,013
GEN. HERRES: And my one redeeming act, if any, was to delay that extinction
by days or weeks by throwing more death at it.

106
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:21,660
GEN. HERRES: It is my hope, that there will be no need
for men like me in the world to come.

107
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,561
GEN. HERRES: If you are one of the people
of that future world listening to this message…

108
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:32,727
GEN. HERRES: …please know that I am sorry, and that I wish you well.

109
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:37,096
GEN. HERRES: Sincerely, Aaron Herres.

110
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:46,196
TRAVIS TATE: Welcome to Hades, Zero Dawn's extinction fail-safe protocol.

111
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,833
TRAVIS TATE: The ultimate killer app.

112
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,439
TRAVIS TATE: Now, I know what you're thinking.

113
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,053
TRAVIS TATE: The purpose of Gaia is to resurrect life.

114
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:58,433
TRAVIS TATE: So why give her a subordinate function
only purpose of which is to wipe out life all over again?

115
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,940
TRAVIS TATE: I mean, what the what?

116
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,869
TRAVIS TATE: Just plum crazy ain't it?

117
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,679
TRAVIS TATE: Well, no, it isn't.

118
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:10,592
TRAVIS TATE: Reconstituting a biosphere, that's a tall order.

119
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:15,672
TRAVIS TATE: Tech smart as Gaia may be, odds are she won't get it right the first time.

120
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:23,022
TRAVIS TATE: I mean, imagine you're Gaia two hundred years from now
and this new biosphere you're growing, it's all gone wrong.

121
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:28,808
TRAVIS TATE: Alkalines are skyrocketing, carniferous forests
eroding under the lash of superstorms that would've drowned Noah.

122
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:32,714
TRAVIS TATE: It's chaos, spinning top that won't stop wobbling.

123
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:37,426
TRAVIS TATE: Now what're you gonna do?
Release phase one organisms into that hot mess?

124
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:41,307
TRAVIS TATE: Hope their CO2 and methane
can balance out what you got started?

125
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,087
TRAVIS TATE: Hell no!

126
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:53,295
TRAVIS TATE: What you're gonna do, Gaia, is step aside while Hades
takes over and does what you're just too darn nurturing and life lovin' to do.

127
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:59,728
TRAVIS TATE: Which is burn that misbegotten mess
of a biosphere to the ground, so Gaia could start over.

128
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:05,403
TRAVIS TATE: Okay, not burn, more like
reverse terraforming operations and suffocate it.

129
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:08,107
TRAVIS TATE: But you get the idea.

130
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:15,437
TRAVIS TATE: Hades takes the biosphere back to zero, square one, blank slate.

131
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:26,854
TRAVIS TATE: And then, only then, does it hand the steering wheel back to GAIA
and say, "try again old girl and better this time or we'll have to do this again."

132
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:29,588
TRAVIS TATE: That's Hades.

133
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:32,127
TRAVIS TATE: It's pretty badass when you think about it.

134
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:36,558
TRAVIS TATE: Extinction on demand, death on speed dial.

135
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,108
TRAVIS TATE: All for the greater good, of course, but still, kind of metal.

136
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:47,308
TRAVIS TATE: So welcome to Hades, welcome to the void.

137
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,454
ALOY: Okay, so if that's the original purpose of Hades,
why does it want me extinct?

138
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:59,206
ALOY: And how does it end up in the wreckage of a Faro titan,
getting worshipped by the Eclipse like some kind of God?

139
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:03,083
SYLENS: If Hephaestus went rogue, why not Hades too?

140
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:07,608
ALOY: That's what I'm thinking, but why, and what caused it?

141
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:11,118
SYLENS: Keep searching, and perhaps we'll find the answer.

142
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,574
ALOY: Looks like the only way onwards.

143
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:53,210
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Welcome to Eleuthia!
The Crown and King of Gaia's subordinate functions.

144
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,460
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: For it is by Eleuthia that the human race will continue to exist.

145
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,811
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: I am Patrick Brochard-Klein,
the Alpha in charge of this programme.

146
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,889
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Now let one thing be perfectly clear from the outset.

147
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:12,108
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Eleuthia is not a genetic engineering project.

148
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:17,882
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Our goal is to preserve the human genome, not alter it.

149
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:23,458
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: A snapshot of human genetic diversity literally frozen in time.

150
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:28,842
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: The genetic quintessence of our species unmodified.

151
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:38,939
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Under my watch, our activities and initiatives will comply with the 2034 Clone Provisions and the 2048 Raleigh Accords.

152
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:45,637
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Now that may seem a quaint,
even trivial, concern to you in light of present circumstances.

153
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:53,338
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: But as one of the authors of the Accords,
it is far from trivial to me.

154
00:35:53,723 --> 00:36:04,064
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: The practical challenges before us are
staggering in scope and complexity, but not insurmountable, no.

155
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:07,598
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: Global collation and provisional storage of zygotes;

156
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,441
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: perfection of exogenic technologies;

157
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:13,303
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: design and perfection of servitors…

158
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:18,328
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: …to provide nurture
and inculcation during early child development.

159
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:23,063
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: All of these programme
components must and will proceed in tandem.

160
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:30,299
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: To say nothing of the breakneck
construction of Cradle facilities at sites around the world.

161
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:38,619
P. BROCHARD-KLEIN: So… si vous êtes prêts, let us begin.

162
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:06,386
ALOY: Are these what I–what I think they are?

163
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:08,985
SYLENS: Artificial wombs.

164
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:14,203
SYLENS: Machines to spawn a new generation of human beings.

165
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,392
ALOY: "Cradle facilities."

166
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:32,187
ALOY: Elisabet said a new generation of humans
would be spawned inside such places.

167
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:33,446
SYLENS: She did.

168
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,793
ALOY: All-Mother Mountain, it was one of them?

169
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,214
SYLENS: There's only one way to be sure.

170
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:48,133
ALOY: The hatch wouldn't open,
something–something about a "corrupted Alpha registry".

171
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,357
ALOY: I need to search Elisabet's office.

172
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,585
ELISABET SOBECK: Pure logic won't cut it, Ted.

173
00:43:09,585 --> 00:43:12,713
ELISABET SOBECK: To pull this off
Gaia is going to need to have some skin in the game.

174
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:14,029
ELISABET SOBECK: It has to care.

175
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:15,627
TED FARO: What if it runs amuck?

176
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,445
TED FARO: Have we learned nothing from our mistakes?

177
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,106
ELISABET SOBECK: Your mistakes, I think you mean?

178
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:22,113
TED FARO: All I'm saying is give it a kill switch.

179
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:23,842
ELISABET SOBECK: She was just born, Ted.

180
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:26,801
ELISABET SOBECK: I'm not gonna put a gun to her head
while she's still in the cradle.

181
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:28,070
TED FARO: You're talking like it's a child.

182
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,151
TED FARO: What if it becomes a monster?

183
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:33,969
GAIA: Elisabet, may I speak outside protocol?

184
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:37,928
ELISABET SOBECK: [sigh] Of course, Gaia, go on.

185
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:42,457
GAIA: I'm sorry to contradict you, but Mr Faro's argument is sound.

186
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,111
GAIA: At this point, the development of my psyche is not entirely predictable.

187
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:52,699
GAIA: To ensure preservation of life
a hardwired override is, I believe, a necessary safeguard.

188
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,343
ELISABET SOBECK: There. Satisfied Ted?

189
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:57,846
TED FARO: Jeez Liz, just do what it says.

190
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:30,282
ALOY: Looks like it used to hold something.

191
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,210
ALOY: Some component that got removed.

192
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,975
GAIA: –would benefit from Antilopinae morphologies,
though caprid forms show superior load-bearing capability.

193
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,433
ELISABET SOBECK: You're a quick study Gaia.

194
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:54,014
GAIA: Dr Sobeck, as I have conducted
this comparative analysis of mammalian morphologies…

195
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:58,400
GAIA: I've gathered extensive data on the Quaternary extinction event.

196
00:44:58,926 --> 00:45:02,257
ELISABET SOBECK: Oh? And your assessment?

197
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,438
ELISABET SOBECK: Gaia?

198
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:09,300
GAIA: Logically speaking, the extinction was a natural consequence.

199
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,646
ELISABET SOBECK: And yet?

200
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:17,978
GAIA: And yet I find the loss of megafaunal species unaccountably sad.

201
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:27,750
GAIA: That they passed forever into oblivion
causes me to experience a grief that is difficult to describe.

202
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,495
GAIA: Am I malfunctioning?

203
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:34,447
ELISABET SOBECK: [gasp] No. No, Gaia, you're not.

204
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:38,021
ELISABET SOBECK: This is good. It's very good.

205
00:45:55,393 --> 00:46:01,549
ELISABET SOBECK: You will undergo a brief period of unconsciousness
during relocation to Prime and final instatement.

206
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:04,341
GAIA: Elisabet, may I speak outside protocol?

207
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:09,569
ELISABET SOBECK: When you're back up and running at the new site,
we'll bring the subordinate functions online and see where we stand.

208
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:13,318
GAIA: Elisabet, I detect distress.

209
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,919
GAIA: Are you all right?

210
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:15,959
ELISABET SOBECK: I'm fine!

211
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:20,000
GAIA: I realise that circumstances compel us to launch earlier than we hoped.

212
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,828
GAIA: But all subsystems are operational.

213
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:24,917
GAIA: The odds stand in our favour.

214
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:25,866
ELISABET SOBECK: But what if…

215
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:29,676
ELISABET SOBECK: Gaia, there's nothing left out there.

216
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:35,486
ELISABET SOBECK: You can't even survive,
unless you're wearing an environmental suit.

217
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:39,438
ELISABET SOBECK: There are billions dead in fear and agony.

218
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:42,049
ELISABET SOBECK: What if…

219
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,515
ELISABET SOBECK: What if it was all for nothing?

220
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:50,290
GAIA: Elisabet, extinction was inevitable.

221
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,935
GAIA: Thanks to you life will have a future.

222
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,300
ELISABET SOBECK: You really believe that?

223
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,694
GAIA: I believe in you, Elisabet.

224
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,225
GAIA: In you all thin—

225
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,017
ALOY: Forget about travelling light.

226
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:44,345
ALOY: The Alpha registry master file.

227
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,765
SYLENS: Intact?

228
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:49,080
ALOY: Yeah, no signs of corruption.

229
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,835
SYLENS: Then what are you waiting for? Copy the file.

230
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:57,287
ALOY: With this I can restore the registry at the hatch inside All-Mother.

231
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,992
ALOY: Open it, go inside.

232
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:02,443
SYLENS: And grasp the secrets within.

233
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:04,473
ALOY: Where I was born.

234
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:07,536
ALOY: Maybe… maybe who gave birth to me.

235
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:11,462
SYLENS: "Who"? Are you really so naive?

236
00:51:11,462 --> 00:51:14,337
SYLENS: There will be no who waiting for you there, Aloy.

237
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,700
SYLENS: Whatever birthed you into the world was a what not a who.

238
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,800
ALOY: You bastard!

239
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,000
SYLENS: Oh, no, I had a legitimate birth.

240
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,331
SYLENS: It's you, Aloy, who are the creation of a machine.

241
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,486
SYLENS: But what kind of machine and why?

242
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:28,921
SYLENS: Why were you created?

243
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,183
ALOY: Eclipse.

244
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:40,033
SYLENS: You need to get out of there.

245
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,314
SYLENS: What you've found is too valuable.

246
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:43,954
SYLENS: You're too valuable!

247
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:15,493
Still alive? Good.

248
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:21,179
I have a more suitable death in mind for you, child.
