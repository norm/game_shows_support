1
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,429
I take it you know who I am 

2
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,890
I do.

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,559
I know a lot of people didn't want you in
the Proving.

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,320
But if you hadn't been there,
everyone would've died.

5
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:35,360
Shows how much we know.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,970
The very person we needed
was someone the tribe never wanted.

7
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:42,792
I wish I could borrow some of your courage now.

8
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,243
For him.

9
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,769
Nothing I do comforts him.

10
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,300
I don't even have any Dreamwillow to ease his pain.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,534
There should be some in stashes along
Brave Trails to the east, but…

12
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,226
These will keep.

13
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,615
The Brave Trail.

14
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,820
Should be a cache of Dreamwillow up there.

15
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:36,247
No Dreamwillow, just a few shards.

16
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,829
I'll tuck that away.

17
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,480
Saving these for the trail.

18
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,634
Might be a cache of Dreamwillow along that Brave Trail.

19
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,373
Strange.

20
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,265
Looks like someone swapped all
the Dreamwillow in these caches for shards.

21
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,117
There's no Dreamwillow in these caches.

22
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:44,418
Fia will want to know.

23
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,167
You're back.

24
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,454
I've already been to those stashes.

25
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,734
All I found was a few shards.

26
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:54,550
That's strange, who would have taken the Dreamwillow?

27
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,960
It's possible that Jun has gathered more.

28
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,860
He may be a recluse but he helps the tribe
by picking herbs and brewing medicines.

29
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,427
The problem is that he lives west of Mother's Crown,

30
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:09,663
and machines in that region are troublesome.

31
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,753
What sort of machines?

32
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:14,831
Scrappers and Sawtooths.

33
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:17,493
It's quite dangerous.

34
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,934
You could ask him if you're willing to make
the journey.

35
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,351
I'll be on my way.

36
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,534
Of course.

37
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,788
[praying Nora]
Goddess please. We are your faithful children.

38
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,767
[praying Nora]
Show us mercy.

39
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,507
Keep quiet now.

40
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,079
Tough, but i'm used to it.

41
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,361
Down you go!

42
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,700
Just stand by for now.

43
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,967
Snow haze, white as bone.

44
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,867
Huh, that thought got dark.

45
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,494
Look out below!

46
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:51,029
[in the distance]
Help!

47
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:56,309
[in the cabin]
I'm locked in!

48
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,339
[in the cabin]
Someone!

49
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:06,047
[in the cabin]
Is someone there?

50
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,951
All-Mother be praised!

51
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,006
I thought I'd never be freed.

52
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,270
What happened?

53
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,150
A gang of outcasts, that's what.

54
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,310
They burst in, stole my Dreamwillow,
and left me to die.

55
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,720
A "gang" of outcasts?

56
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,470
Yes a gang.

57
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,290
The door crashed open, I didn't stand a chance.

58
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,010
They grabbed my Dreamwillow and left me for dead.

59
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,670
Why would outcasts steal your Dreamwillow?

60
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,670
Why?

61
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,230
Because it's the most valuable
herb I gather of course.

62
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,570
Miserable thieves.

63
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,460
They took nothing else?

64
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
No.

65
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,220
Mark my words they have struck a deal with outsiders.

66
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,006
It's shards they're after and they'll kill to get it.

67
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,010
Which way did the outcasts go?

68
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,110
Up the mountain I think.

69
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,820
You might catch them if you hurry.

70
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,340
Whatever you do, don't let their shabby looks fool you.

71
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,600
They'll kill you as soon as look at you.

72
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,380
Uhhh, I need to catch my breath.

73
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,360
Yeah, you could stop talking for a start.

74
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,905
The outcasts must have left tracks.

75
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,593
My Focus should pick them up.

76
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:25,034
Well someone left here recently, and they were in a hurry.

77
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,090
[in the distance]
Got it!

78
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,929
[in the distance]
Hit it again!

79
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:56,230
[in the distance]
I'm out of arrows.

80
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,553
The outcasts that took the Dreamwillow,
and they're in trouble.

81
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:13,103
[in the distance]
Kill it!

82
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,879
[in the distance]
Finish it!

83
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,000
I can get out of this.

84
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,425
[in the distance]
Don't lose your target!

85
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,090
I'm out!

86
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:06,107
[in the distance]
Yes!

87
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,174
[in the distance]
You hurt it!

88
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,504
[in the distance]
All-Mother be praised!

89
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,671
[in the distance]
Good shot!

90
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,577
[in the distance]
Good shot!

91
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,450
You have our thanks, if the gratitude
of outcasts means anything to you.

92
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,720
It does.

93
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,059
You not only save us but speak to us.

94
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,710
The Matriarchs cast me out at birth.

95
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,280
The laws of the Nora don't mean much to me.

96
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,900
Then you're that girl whose mother never claimed her.

97
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,510
But an outcast no longer.

98
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,490
No. A Seeker in fact.

99
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,080
What crimes did you and the others commit?

100
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,620
I beat a man who stole my kill, it was my wrong.

101
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,970
The others stole, broke custom, or trespassed
among the bones of the Metal World.

102
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,580
No murderers here if that's what you're asking.

103
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,320
Why did you take the Dreamwillow?

104
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,680
Because we have wounded.
Why else would we take it?

105
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,580
Something terrible has happened to the tribe.

106
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,309
The Braves offer no protection.

107
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,410
The machines are angry and bandits infest
the Sacred Land and prey upon us.

108
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,689
Why else would outcasts break custom and band
together but that we have no choice.

109
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,900
Even so, we did not steal.

110
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,569
We left shards in the stashes, and tried to pay Jun.

111
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,480
But of course he would not speak to us.

112
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,261
Jun said you roughed him up.

113
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:14,801
He was too busy cringing to know what happened.

114
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,420
The man's a coward.

115
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,510
We made sure not to hurt him,
not that he seemed to notice.

116
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,330
There are others who need Dreamwillow,
you can't have all of it.

117
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,490
You asking or demanding?

118
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,880
Talking.

119
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,600
One person to another.

120
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,670
I see.

121
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,740
Perhaps we have more than we need.

122
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,000
After everything that happened we were afraid.

123
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,370
We took all we could find.

124
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,183
Here.

125
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:42,259
I'll keep a portion but the rest…

126
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:45,120
May it find its way to those who need it.

127
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,800
I'll see that it does.

128
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,780
In the meantime stay safe and stick together.

129
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,367
You gave us a better deal than
the Matriarchs ever would have, thanks.

130
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,080
Here's the Dreamwillow.

131
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,830
Take it to Fia in Mother's Rise.

132
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,760
There are wounded Braves there who need it badly.

133
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,500
I will, but what became of the outcasts?

134
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,848
Did those wretches pay for their crimes?

135
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:06,390
Ganging up together,
speaking to each other, and to us!

136
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,750
I hope you showed them no mercy.

137
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,670
It's funny how you hate outcasts so much Jun.

138
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,550
Living out here all alone you're practically
one yourself.

139
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,050
I happily keep my own company.

140
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,730
Good for you, since I don't exactly see anyone
beating down the door to spend time with you.

141
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,620
Except outcasts in need of Dreamwillow that is.

142
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,840
You don't know who I am do you?

143
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Should I?

144
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,380
I was raised as an outcast
in the mountains above Mother's Heart.

145
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,210
The motherless girl!

146
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,360
If I'd known I never would have spoken to you.

147
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,420
And yet it's this "motherless girl" who freed you
and recovered your Dreamwillow for the tribe.

148
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,820
Maybe if you judged people less
you wouldn't be so lonely.

149
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,100
I have no need of others.

150
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,180
Then congratulations Jun, you've managed to shun yourself.

151
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,290
At least I'm no outcast.

152
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,110
That's right, you're not even that.

153
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,759
The outcasts reached out to each other, but you?

154
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,340
You're nothing!

155
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,670
I'm done here.

156
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,519
Make sure that Fia gets that Dreamwillow or I'll be back.

157
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:38,276
These'll keep.

158
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:10,470
They're scanning for me.

159
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,001
Oh, useful.

160
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,990
Mother's Crown.

161
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,560
Feels more like a military camp.

162
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,950
I bet this village has seen better days.

163
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,550
So many wounded, the tribe's been hit hard.

164
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,400
[wounded Nora]
I hope I never see a corrupted machine again.

165
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,020
Here she is!

166
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,200
They made her a Seeker!

167
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,596
Come here girl, let's have a look at you.

168
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,830
The girl with the mark of a Seeker.

169
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,829
The sentinels saw you coming.

170
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:23,520
You're Marea, so you're in charge of the defenses here.

171
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,590
Mother's Crown defends itself.

172
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,950
During the war it survived fifteen assaults,
broke three invasions.

173
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,530
We will endure.

174
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,951
Trying to live up to glorious pasts has a
way of getting people killed.

175
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:38,290
You wouldn't know this
but I won the Proving the year I ran.

176
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,090
Like you I started off behind, had to find a shortcut.

177
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,490
I barely made it.

178
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,040
Crossed the finish line with a broken ankle.

179
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,900
Getting posted to Mother's Crown,
it was the boon I requested.

180
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,910
My prize for winning.

181
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,582
Trying to live up to the glory of the Nora hasn't killed me yet.

182
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:56,883
But if it has to, I'm willing.

183
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,000
Mother's Crown guards the edge of the Sacred Land, right?

184
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,080
So do you see a lot of foreigners here?

185
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Yes.

186
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,290
Not here in the village itself of course.

187
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,450
But in the valley beyond.

188
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,320
Since the war ended foreigners have been allowed in the valley,

189
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,450
and Nora can trade with them if they choose.

190
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,210
It's a kind of in-between place, neither foreign nor Sacred Land.

191
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,109
If you're curious visit Hunter's Gathering.

192
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,040
It's little more than a heap of dingy shelters and tents,

193
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,220
but foreigners use it as a way station.

194
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,040
Varl told me you'd know the way to Meridian.

195
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,420
The Carja capital?

196
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,270
West will take you to it.

197
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,480
But their soldiers will stop you long before you get there.

198
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
They can try.

199
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,410
No, what I mean is there's a Carja fort
that guards the pass between east and west.

200
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,493
Word is the Carja have sealed the gate,

201
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:47,650
out of fear of the corrupted machines
infesting our Sacred Land.

202
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,010
The Carja call the place Daytower.

203
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,849
It's not far from the forsaken village.

204
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,440
What forsaken village?

205
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,730
It had a name once, not that it matters now.

206
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,270
I was born there.

207
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,490
What happened to it?

208
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,790
The war.

209
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,070
The Carja destroyed it in one of their Red Raids.

210
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,440
I was 15 at the time.

211
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,430
I got away, others weren't so lucky.

212
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,347
Even now with the war behind us we've left the valley be.

213
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:13,697
A kind of buffer between the Sundom and our Sacred Land.

214
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,020
How far has the corruption spread?

215
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,260
I've seen it myself in machines at the head of the valley.

216
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,010
And there's been word of corrupted machines in the south too.

217
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,859
Whatever the corruption is it doesn't just affect machines.

218
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,190
It burns flesh and sickens the injured.

219
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,220
Do the corrupted machines have any weaknesses?

220
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,553
Fire seems to affect them more than ordinary machines.

221
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:36,554
A small mercy.

222
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,710
This is a curse only the Goddess can lift.

223
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,910
Unless we find out what's behind it and put a stop to it.

224
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,250
The Matriarchs have spoken, Aloy.

225
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,780
All we can do is fight and pray to the Goddess.

226
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,850
I should be going.

227
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,930
All right.

228
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,210
Be careful out there Aloy.

229
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,569
I hope you find whatever it is you're after.

230
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,326
Solai should be around here somewhere

231
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,330
Are you Solai?

232
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,160
Yan said your niece may have come through here, Nakoa?

233
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,000
I've got nothing to say about that.

234
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,220
Please, I only want to help.

235
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,090
I'm a Seeker, headed north.

236
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,174
Yan wanted me to help find her.

237
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:57,839
Anything you tell me stays between us.

238
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,119
I've…

239
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,190
I gave her supplies for the journey.

240
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,100
She was headed for Daytower, looking for Zaid.

241
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,430
I told Nakoa not to go.

242
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,690
What's a lone Nora gonna do there?

243
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:12,490
Bastards used to gather Nora captives there,
so they could ship them to Meridian for slaughter.

244
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,330
What do you know of Zaid?

245
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,580
He's a rabid animal, a murderer.

246
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,500
The worst of the Red Raiders.

247
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,860
Killed my brother while poor Nakoa watched from the shadows.

248
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,890
Even as I begged her not to go, part of me wanted her to.

249
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,830
I need him dead as much as she does.

250
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,880
I understand, better than you think.

251
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,570
You can't imagine what it's like.

252
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:40,000
He … he mutilated my brother and yet he walks free among the Carja!

253
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,022
I'll look for Nakoa when I reach Daytower.

254
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,170
Just don't mention why you're asking.

255
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,334
I won't, I promise.

256
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:25,800
Oh it's you.

257
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,580
The outcast turned Seeker.

258
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,480
I've heard you're good with bow and spear.

259
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,600
Yeah, some even say you're the best.

260
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,520
I think I hear a challenge in there somewhere,
and I'm not interested.

261
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,380
I have more important things to do.

262
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,370
Oh, I see.

263
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,750
The Seeker doesn't have time for us lesser Nora.

264
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,980
Too busy hunting machines and marauders.

265
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,450
Do you try to provoke everyone you talk to?

266
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:55,620
Well I can't claim to have faced the corrupted,
or danced with demons.

267
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,570
But I have earned a few suns at
the Hunting Grounds at Valleymeet.

268
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:05,180
I took down machines with three different
types of arrows, freeze, shock, and fire.

269
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,420
Have you?

270
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,940
Or maybe your seeking hasn't taken you that far.

271
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,980
Is that even in the Sacred Lands?

272
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,770
Depends on who you ask.

273
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:20,000
It used to be ours but since the Red Raids ended,
the border is a bit … unclear.

274
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,720
The keeper's a Carja.

275
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,340
He can't refuse anyone the trials but don't come on too strong.

276
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,450
If your seeking takes you to the Hunting Grounds
you'd better come equipped.

277
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,770
But I'm sure a Seeker is always prepared, right?

278
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,530
See if you can earn a Blazing Sun.

279
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,179
If you do, you'll know you beat me.

280
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:39,768
Consider it done.

281
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:18,092
[in the distance]
My own damn fault, I should have got out of there quick.

282
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,026
What happened to you, Hunter?

283
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,076
Are you all right?

284
00:46:32,076 --> 00:46:34,730
Oh I'm grateful for this wound.

285
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,130
It's a lesson I won't forget, and you should heed it too.

286
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,450
How's that?

287
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,800
I was chasing a galloping Grazer.

288
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,650
So intent on my prey that I didn't see where I was going.

289
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,840
Right to the threshold of a Cauldron.

290
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,880
For a moment I was a child again,
rapt from stories told by Hunters at the campfire.

291
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:59,164
I had a powerful desire to see what was inside.

292
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,231
That's when the Watcher attacked.

293
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:03,570
Cauldrons are guarded, you see.

294
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:07,840
I barely fought it off and got this scrape as a reminder.

295
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,760
A "cauldron"? What's that?

296
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,090
Ah, you're from inside the Embrace, so you've never seen one.

297
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,599
A Cauldron is a sort of door, I guess.

298
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,000
No-one knows what lies beyond.

299
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,652
Whatever they are, they're forbidden.

300
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:27,230
We weren't meant to see what's inside.

301
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,869
I'll never waver again, this scar will see to that.

302
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:35,385
But for a moment you felt something, a sense of discovery.

303
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,263
Are you so sure that's a bad thing?

304
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:38,600
Has to be, right?

305
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,470
Or I wouldn't have been punished.

306
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,390
Where can I find this Cauldron?

307
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,540
My point is you shouldn't.

308
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,591
Then describe the place I should avoid.

309
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:52,619
You're a clever one, but not so clever
as to heed my warning I see.

310
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,700
Fine, you're grown, I can't stop you.

311
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,260
It's dead north of here, past the Red Drifts.

312
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,510
Just remember I told you to stay away.

313
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,920
[wounded Nora]
It's spreading. The corrupted machines they're everywhere.

314
00:48:11,664 --> 00:48:14,500
[wounded Nora]
The machines, they've been driven mad.

315
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:46,496
Might be fascinating if they weren't looking for me.

316
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:16,034
Ready or not…!
