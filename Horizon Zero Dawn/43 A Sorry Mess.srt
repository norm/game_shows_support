1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,629
ALOY: For your punishment they'll exile you from the werak?

2
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,820
INATUT: From warmth.

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,943
INATUT: March me up the slopes of the Cloud-Shear.
Leave me stripped and exposed.

4
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,750
ALOY: That's awful.

5
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,509
INATUT: If I survive, the land has absolved me.

6
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,900
INATUT: That's the law. It must be accepted.

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,189
ALOY: Still awful.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,159
INATUT: I'm not stupid, I don't like my chances either.

9
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,850
INATUT: I can't fight a mountain.

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,030
ALOY: I'll be honest, you haven't got a good defence, Inatut.

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,569
INATUT: I've heard that one before.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,969
ALOY: Where did the fight happen?

13
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,990
INATUT: A clearing, just outside the Carja outlander's camp.

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,738
INATUT: You should talk to them, they wouldn't hear me out.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,699
They say no-one else could have been there, other than me and the dead man.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,280
The Shaman consulted the signs in the snow and agreed.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,849
ALOY: I'll see what I can find out and I'll be back.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,582
INATUT: I'll be here. What else am I gonna do?

19
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:13,299
Until the horn gives a call for my exile.

20
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,439
ALOY: For what you did another Banuk has been sentenced to certain death.

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,969
What about his song?

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,689
RUKUL: That's why you followed us?

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,008
For that punch-drunk idiot Inatut.

24
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,973
[horn blares in the distance]

25
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,150
RUKUL: Fate is sharp today.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,450
They've already led him out to face his exile.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,461
Let's see who the cold claims first.

28
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,750
ALOY: I need to go after Inatut.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,549
ALOY: But I should find some more evidence first.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,769
Trophies.

31
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,750
Newer than the rest.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,829
It must have belonged to Ruwas.

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,848
So it was a Carja soldier's.

34
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,060
Not that it's any excuse.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,849
Did they keep any clothes from their victims?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,949
This Carja gear's not warm.

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,038
But if Inatut's naked on a snowfield, he'll take what he gets.

38
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay, time to get moving.

39
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,389
There!

40
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,269
It's a start!

41
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,118
Kind of place you'd take someone if you wanted to lose them forever.

42
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,025
I'm not getting up that frozen waterfall.

43
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,050
Maybe along the sides?

44
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,850
Now's my chance.

45
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,529
Low and quiet does it.

46
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,049
Chill almost feels like sunburn.

47
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,057
Inatut? INATUT!

48
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,250
Maybe he found shelter?

49
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,643
I hope he found shelter.

50
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,000
Behind the rock.

51
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,450
INATUT: The Nora girl?

52
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,230
INATUT: Is it really you, or has the bone chill got through my skull?

53
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,309
ALOY: I found the real killers.

54
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,279
ALOY: No-one else has to die because of this.

55
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,440
ALOY: Take these.

56
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,149
INATUT: A dead Carja's clothes? Haven't I been beaten down enough?

57
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,850
INATUT: But I won't argue.

58
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,000
INATUT: Swear I thought I saw my ancestors.

59
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,049
INATUT: They said "Weren't surprised you ended up here."

60
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:57,277
ALOY: Better hurry — machines!

61
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,629
INATUT: Now that was a fight!

62
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,509
ALOY: Your trial's over. It was other Banuk who killed that man.

63
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,320
ALOY: Killed him because he was Carja.

64
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,750
INATUT: You know why I took the first swing at him?

65
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,250
INATUT: He challenged the honour of the Banuk.

66
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:07,850
INATUT: The honour.

67
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,298
INATUT: That's what I thought.

68
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,570
ALOY: Come on, let's get you back.

69
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,450
INATUT: Once I'm off the mountain, I'll find my own way.

70
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,149
INATUT: I need to think.

71
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,879
INATUT: It's not something I'm used to.

72
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,710
INATUT: Who knows what could happen?

73
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,105
ALOY: I'll see you in town, then.

74
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,740
ALOY: You'd better make it, alright?

75
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,389
INATUT: I give my pledge.

76
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,704
ALOY: So by Banuk law if Inatut survives he's forgiven.

77
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,500
But I want to prove to his chieftain that he wasn't guilty in the first place.

78
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,149
Just like in the Cauldron.

79
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:35,950
All of the winters coming at once.

80
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,423
BANUK: How can we expect any Shaman to fill the footprints Ourea left behind?

81
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,505
BANUK: The hunting party said the Rockbreaker burst from the ice
just in front of them. They're lucky to be alive.

82
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,662
BANUK: Some say the Tallneck at the Frostfigures is
some sort of spiritual site. That's just a dead machine.

83
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,430
BANUK: Some days it seems like the blue light has no hold any more.

84
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,279
ALOY: Inatut told you the truth.

85
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,210
This is the headdress stolen from the murdered man.

86
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,739
You'll find more in a ravine north and west of here.

87
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,799
Along with the bodies of the killers.

88
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,808
AUJAK: The exile still served its purpose.

89
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,220
AUJAK: He was guilty of our suspicion.

90
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,859
Fate has fallen like snow, and should Inatut return he will be absolved.

91
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,609
ALOY: You can't be serious!

92
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:45,680
INATUT: He speaks for the werak my Nora friend.

93
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,269
KOPILAI: You look ridiculous.

94
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,108
KOPILAI: If you would return to my werak, you will behave as a Banuk does.

95
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:54,735
INATUT: How does a Banuk behave my chieftain?

96
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:59,793
INATUT: Like I did, accepting a sentence for a crime he did not commit?

97
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:06,779
Or those others who killed in cold blood
for crimes that their Carja victims did not?

98
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,289
I think what I wear will not make me more or less of a Banuk.

99
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,140
KOPILAI: For his own sake it would be wise for him to think less, "Nora friend".

100
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,349
ALOY: I'll talk to him, but not for you.

101
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:49,534
INATUT: I defied my chieftains will, spurned my werak.

102
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:50,858
ALOY: How are you feeling?

103
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:53,849
INATUT: As if I've been pounded in the guts.

104
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,958
INATUT: I could just keep walking, but…

105
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:03,660
INATUT: …when my anger has thawed it will leave me with nothing.

106
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,900
INATUT: Where else would I go?

107
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,172
ALOY: There's so much more out there, beyond your borders and laws.

108
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:14,299
ALOY: It won't be easy but I know you can roll with the hits.

109
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:20,038
INATUT: But without a werak?
To be a Banuk alone, what would I be fighting for?

110
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,753
ALOY: How about yourself Inatut? You just did it.

111
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:29,480
INATUT: Huh. I am Inatut who fights for himself.

112
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,089
INATUT: There's a good echo to it,
and so many unknown mountaintops to shout it from!

113
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,259
ALOY: You can decide for yourself what it means to be a Banuk.

114
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:43,825
ALOY: It might not be what the chieftain and the Shaman tell you.

115
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:49,509
INATUT: I'm better with decisions like do I start with the left or the right?

116
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,039
ALOY: There is more to you than your fists, Inatut.

117
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:53,950
ALOY: That's why I believed you.

118
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,980
INATUT: It was my chieftain who taught me honesty.

119
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,759
INATUT: Said "A Banuk should not be treacherous
when the ice is treacherous enough."

120
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,799
ALOY: You survived exile, I bet that doesn't happen much.

121
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,489
INATUT: I've only heard of it in legends.

122
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,078
ALOY: You earned your place in the werak Inatut, make them earn you back.

123
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:19,689
INATUT: Of all my fights, this is the first time I beat death.

124
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,409
INATUT: I'll sit with my bruises for a time, then talk with her again.

125
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,690
INATUT: As for you Nora girl, will you accept this gift?

126
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,873
INATUT: A little scrawny weighed against the great boon you gave me, but…

127
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:36,010
ALOY: I'm honoured. Thank you, Inatut.

128
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,140
BANUK: Can't be, he'd be older than the first song by now.

129
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,154
FURAHNI: Huntress. We should thank you for finding the truth in this sorry mess.

130
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,769
Your Banuk came to us to explain what happened,
wearing a long dead Carja's garb.

131
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,419
The priest thought he was having a religious vision.

132
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,950
ALOY: I have brought back the stolen headdress too.

133
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,022
ALOY: The inscription inside said it was a soldier's?

134
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,950
FURAHNI: An heirloom, handed down to Ruwas.

135
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,569
FURAHNI: His father gave his life to help liberate Meridian.

136
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,109
FURAHNI: He was no Red Raider.

137
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,129
ALOY: What a waste!

138
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,920
FURAHNI: Like I said, a sorry mess.

139
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,683
FURAHNI: Well, we'll be returning to the Sundom. May you also go in light.

140
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,526
CARJA: The Sun-King's grown too soft. Too much Oseram influence in the palace.

141
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,380
BANUK: We've no time to host outsiders.

142
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,000
BANUK: I'll give this to the Oseram. Whatever they do, they do it with passion.

143
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,660
KOPILAI: There was an old Banuk tradition
to determine who had the strongest will.

144
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,309
KOPILAI: Some parts of Ban-Ur still use it.

145
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,890
KOPILAI: You take a hot coal in your fist,
and then hold it until you must plunge it into the snow.

146
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,400
KOPILAI: There were many warriors in those days
with a strong will and a ruined hand.

147
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,259
KOPILAI: I should have dropped the coal.

148
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,308
KOPILAI: Do you understand?

149
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,109
INATUT: Uh, I'm trying, my chieftain.

150
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,220
KOPILAI: I hewed to tradition
even though I was certain you did not commit the crime.

151
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,390
KOPILAI: I was wrong.

152
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,349
KOPILAI: You should not have to fight
for the werak's honour without knowing that.

153
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,541
INATUT: I've only heard my chieftain apologise once before.

154
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,778
INATUT: And that was to the old chieftain on the end of her spear.

155
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,611
ALOY: I think you got the better deal then.

156
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:46,189
I'd say look after yourself, but…

157
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,741
INATUT: Careful doesn't come naturally to me, I know.

158
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:55,038
BANUK: We should not pile his Father's guilt onto
the new Carja king's shoulders. These are different times.

159
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,849
BANUK: A hunt gone sour is no one's fault but the hunters'.

160
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:58,077
INATUT: There I was, atop the Cloud-Shear, the blizzard raining blows upon me.

161
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:05,130
INATUT: Back to back with the Nora warrior,
as the machines closed in, howling for blood.

162
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:13,043
INATUT: My hands were stiff as frozen branches,
still I raised my spear and howled back.

163
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:19,175
INATUT: Blood pounding, fire just flashing before my eyes in the white.

164
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:25,733
INATUT: As metal closed around us, I struck out, chipped the jaws of death.

165
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:29,559
INATUT: Each hit blasted me like thunder.

166
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,925
INATUT: How many could I stand for myself and my ally?

167
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,115
BANUK: But some say your tales are the stuff of campfires, Inatut.

168
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,439
INATUT: Who does? I'll fight them all!

169
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,390
ALOY: It all happened pretty much like he said.

170
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,318
ALOY: I know, I was there.

171
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:48,768
INATUT: And if she hadn't been, I'd be up there still.

172
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,450
INATUT: She did most of the work.

173
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,839
INATUT: It's true, I cheated an exile's fate.

174
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,939
INATUT: But I won't cheat you of your place in this tale.

175
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,618
INATUT: It's a slight tale compared to your own.

176
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:02,440
ALOY: It's not the length of the tale that matters, Inatut.

177
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,490
ALOY: I'm glad to have been a part of yours.

178
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,131
BANUK: Don't forget the Mad Sun-King's cruelty survives him, even if we can trust Meridian…

179
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:50,000
[horn blares]

180
00:32:52,235 --> 00:33:02,962
[horn blares]

181
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,122
We need to be somewhere else, yah!

182
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,276
Low and quiet does it.

183
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,929
I can feel the ground softening up.

184
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,478
That alarm will wake up the whole camp, and more besides.

185
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,320
BANDIT: You hear that?

186
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,159
ALOY: I'm not here.

187
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,356
BANDIT: See her up there!

188
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,800
ALOY: Looks like I'm clear.

189
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:26,789
ALOY: I can't spare the weight.

190
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,489
ALOY: What have they taken prisoners for?

191
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,687
ALOY: Nothing good.

192
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,699
ALOY: You're coming with me.

193
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:01,489
ALOY: Let's get you out of there.

194
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,108
BANDIT: Die, die!

195
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:52,870
NORA: Wild as beasts,
it's like the Metal Devil is whispering to them, corrupting them.

196
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,889
ALOY: Got too much already.

197
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,980
NORA: We will fight the corruption, 'til the last of us has fallen.
