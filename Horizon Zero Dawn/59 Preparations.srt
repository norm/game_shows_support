1
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,607
SYLENS: When I found Hades,
the first thing it wanted to know about was the Spire.

2
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,649
SYLENS: Not Meridian, the Spire.

3
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,269
Now why would that be?

4
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,739
The Spire was created by Gaia.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,270
Which part of Gaia?

6
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:42,375
Minerva, its code breaking module.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,977
Gaia built spires to transmit the codes that deactivated the Faro robots.

8
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:50,950
Shut down their biomatter conversion systems.

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,969
Hades wants to send a new transmission!

10
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,079
To wake the machines so they can devour the world all over again!

11
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,500
Yes, based on what we've learned, that's my conclusion as well.

12
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,000
So the Eclipse, the robots they've resurrected, they're just a means to an end.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,989
An army to capture the Spire!

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,875
Yes, so Hades can exterminate life all over again.

15
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:10,971
No more ammo, this isn't good.

16
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,250
Look at this!

17
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:09,569
GUARD: Don't ask me where to go if you're lost, I'm a guard not the town crier.

18
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,994
GUARD: Now that you've rescued Prince Itamen,
perhaps the Sun-King will end the civil war once and for all.

19
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,000
CARJA: Waste of time; show was better last week.

20
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:25,267
CARJA: Wish I could feel a moment like this every day—

21
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,850
CARJA: Eh, I've seen better.

22
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,050
CARJA: I've seen this four times already.

23
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,001
GUARD: Can't imagine living anywhere else.

24
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,230
GUARD: The Oseram have gone too far this time.
Dervahl should die for his crimes.

25
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,359
GUARD: It's always the ones you least expect that cause you trouble.

26
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:44,778
GUARD: [yawns] No, I'm awake and alert.

27
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,881
GUARD: Always stay bright, always stay alert, that's what I say.

28
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,799
Aloy!

29
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,350
What brings you to Meridian?

30
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,549
A threat.

31
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,050
Helis commands a legion of fanatics called the Eclipse.

32
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,789
They will attack soon, from the West, with an army of ancient war machines.

33
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,019
But that's not the worst of it.

34
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,149
They'll bring a mind with them.

35
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:30,519
God, demon, machine, whatever you want to call it.

36
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,923
It's called Hades and it doesn't want Meridian at all.

37
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,169
It wants the Spire.

38
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:45,549
And if it gets there, it will send out a call
waking more ancient machines, more than we could ever defeat.

39
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,779
All will be lost.

40
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,950
We can't let that happen.

41
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,649
I'm trying to understand, but my responsibility lies with Meridian.

42
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,350
Meridian isn't the target Avad.

43
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,950
You have to defend the Spire.

44
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,255
Perhaps the Vanguard, Your Radiance.

45
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,034
Yes, send them to the Spire.

46
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,929
Erend knows Aloy, he won't question it.

47
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,210
And have the city guard fortify the western ridge.

48
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,860
There they can be seen to protect Meridian and the Alight where the Spire rests.

49
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:26,596
Aloy, allow me to apologise for my behaviour before.

50
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,248
After everything that happened with Ersa, I was confused.

51
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:42,009
If we're to fight together on the brink of life and death,
I'd prefer to do so with your forgiveness.

52
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,600
Then you have it.

53
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,509
As long as you don't confuse me with her again.

54
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,840
Even a king can learn his lesson.

55
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,330
Good then, I'm glad that's behind us.

56
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,840
Now, it will take time to prepare our defences.

57
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,200
Please tell me what you know of our enemies, everything.

58
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,302
I don't know about everything, but I'll tell you what I can.

59
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,129
Have you spoken to blameless Marad?

60
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,800
Not yet, but I will.

61
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,631
He wishes to speak to you, defensive preparations are his responsibility.

62
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,710
MARAD: Quietly does it.

63
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,950
MARAD: Panic in the city will only create another enemy.

64
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,860
MARAD: And do keep me appraised of each new arrival.

65
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,549
Ah, Aloy.

66
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,700
Preparations are underway on the ridge of defences and at the Spire.

67
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,409
Word was sent to every corner of the Sundom.

68
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,570
Our allies offered their steel.

69
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,839
Some came for Meridian, others for shards.

70
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,364
But many came for you, by name.

71
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,860
For me?

72
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,043
Don't be so humble.

73
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:14,149
I suppose all we can do is wait for the attack.

74
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,230
Exactly, it's not a feeling I cherish, but our spotters
at Evening Sign report there's still no movement in the west.

75
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,836
The ridge will be the front line, that's where the city guard are holding?

76
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,800
Yes, bolstered by some of the irregulars.

77
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,526
The Oseram cannons that thundered Meridians walls in the liberation will now defend us.

78
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,082
You're welcome to tour the defences.

79
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,272
And the Spire, Erend and the Vanguard are there?

80
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:46,508
Indeed, clashing breastplates together
and testing out their battle cries I suppose.

81
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,558
A number of the Nora have also arrived at the Spire.

82
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,450
They have resisted the offer of a royal audience.

83
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,950
Perhaps you could parley with them?

84
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,000
I will.

85
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:01,210
So, if there's more you need to do elsewhere sieze this time to do it.

86
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,149
Otherwise, I've made the apartment of Olin Delverson available to you.

87
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,570
You can sleep there, if sleep comes.

88
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,270
GUARD: Has the enemy reached the main gate?

89
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,742
GUARD: Gather bows and spears, don't let them take the city without a fight.

90
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:45,549
MERCHANT: Could you spare a moment to speak of the finer things?

91
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,935
MERCHANT: These aren't goods, they're necessities!

92
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,549
CARJA: Don't watch, hide!

93
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,582
OSERAM: Here's to Avad, eh? He may dress like a—

94
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,050
GUARD: By the Sun, a woman now leads the Hunters Lodge.
What's next? A woman as king?

95
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,587
VANASHA: Have you just polished that armour, Uthid?

96
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,109
UTHID: Of course.

97
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,059
VANASHA: Isn't that a little…?

98
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,160
UTHID: What?

99
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,190
VANASHA: Nothing.

100
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,599
UTHID: Out with a woman.

101
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,516
VANASHA: Forget I said anything, you look very dignified.

102
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,759
UTHID: Thank you.

103
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,414
VANASHA: And shiny. Very shiny.

104
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,789
Aloy! I told you I'd be here.

105
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,670
You did Teb, but have your wounds even had time to heal?

106
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,349
Honestly, if I fought, I'd probably come undone.

107
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,223
But don't worry, I'll leave that to the other Nora at the Spire.

108
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
I brought supplies instead.

109
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,336
These Carja have made me "an honorary quartermaster", whatever that means.

110
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,940
It sounds impressive!

111
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,549
I could get used to it.

112
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,910
We'll be setting up caches of arms and medicine under these banners.

113
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,950
Look for them when the fighting starts.

114
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,619
Aloy? 

115
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,892
When you went into the mountain, did the Goddess tell you our chances?

116
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:30,400
She didn't need to, I know we can do this, Teb.

117
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,680
Maybe we can.

118
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,444
TEB: This place, really couldn't be more different to the Sacred Land could it?
GUARD: We all have our place in the order of things.

119
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:44,759
TEB: There are materials like I've never seen in the markets above.

120
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,369
TEB: I tried to explain Stitchers and Makers to these Carja.
You'd think that wouldn't take much explaining.

121
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,198
Little Huntress, you called so here I am.

122
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,589
Ready to fight?

123
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,680
Fight?

124
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,409
I thought you just wanted tea and conversation.

125
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,807
Is there a battle coming, I wasn't informed.

126
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,589
Well, that can't be true, you're always informed.

127
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,639
Oh, so I am.

128
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
We've only met a few times and yet you know me so well.

129
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:23,806
I don't think I know you at all, but I'd like to.

130
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:28,271
Hmm, when I hear that line it usually means something else.

131
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,099
Can I tell you a secret?

132
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:32,450
Of course.

133
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,579
I've been waiting for this fight my whole life.

134
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:44,028
The enemy we face today is the same that turned Meridian
into a slave pit and Sunfall into a blood bath.

135
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,450
Fanatics who torture and murder mothers, fathers,
families, children, and say it's the will of the Sun.

136
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,083
I hate them, Aloy.

137
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,349
I've got the scars of their whips on my back to prove it.

138
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,569
And today we can get rid of them once and for all.

139
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,950
I said I came for you, but that was only half the truth.

140
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,557
I came for them.

141
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,400
This time they're not getting away.

142
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,934
I'm with you, Vanasha. We'll fight them together.

143
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:18,902
And I won't forget it, little Huntress.

144
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,549
Tomorrow may the Sun rise on a better world.

145
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:31,759
VANASHA: I only fight when I have to, but by the time I have to, I usually want to.

146
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,049
VANASHA: I've put something special on the tips of my arrows for the Eclipse.

147
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,410
VANASHA: It's too bad Bahavas isn't here to see his little friends crushed.

148
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,160
Aloy.

149
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,519
Um, at ease, Uthid.

150
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,234
Meridian will be glad to have you on its side, and I am too.

151
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,869
The honour is mine.

152
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,849
You saved my epitaph from being "A fine soldier but a fool of a man".

153
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,939
I'm hoping you won't need any kind of epitaph just yet.

154
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,880
As the Sun wills.

155
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,759
When you found me, I was trying to eke out a glorious death.

156
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,382
But now a glorious life seems more preferable.

157
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:14,708
To watch Itamen playing the low gardens again…

158
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,129
…still surrounded by a dozen guards, but…

159
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,427
What you did Aloy, it was done well.

160
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,432
Although I can't shake this rogue, Vanasha.

161
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:32,500
She delights in goading me, like brazen colours waved before a Behemoth.

162
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,660
Do you want me to ask her to stop?

163
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,400
No, I accept it.

164
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,089
Well then, Meridian shall stand and shadows shall fall, I swear it.

165
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,197
Here's to that, Uthid.

166
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,660
UTHID: The Sun is my armour, this other armour I wear is a safeguard.

167
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,490
UTHID: Always for a Sun-King, always for Meridian.

168
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,450
UTHID: Every battle we hope to make the last, for the other side.

169
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,505
VANASHA: How many men do you think you'll kill in the battle, Uthid?

170
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,450
UTHID: As many as I have to.

171
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,996
VANASHA: I love it when you say things like that, it's so…

172
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:16,255
UTHID: What?!

173
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,409
VANASHA: Cheerful!

174
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:18,713
UTHID: Grrr.

175
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:27,145
Elida, I'm pleased to see you, but what are you doing here?

176
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,045
I'm helping prepare for the battle.

177
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,938
If Atral were here, we would have fought together, I know it.

178
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,950
So I'm doing everything I can.

179
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,980
Digging battlements, collecting herbs, anything that makes a difference.

180
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,733
I can't take his place, nothing can take his place.

181
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:50,779
But I'm here for him, for both of us.

182
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,450
I understand what it was he saw in you.

183
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,049
He'll always be with me.

184
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,428
Sun and shadow still meet for a moment, every dawn and dusk.

185
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,779
I should give you this, to help in the battle.

186
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,163
By the Sun, I hope you don't need it.

187
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,000
Thank you, Elida. Be safe.

188
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,549
ELIDA: Father understood that I couldn't just stand by in my garden.

189
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,749
ELIDA: Maybe this battle can finally end the war between the Carja.

190
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,519
ELIDA: I should finish up here before the fighting starts.

191
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,640
VANASHA: That's a nice spear, Uthid.

192
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
UTHID: Thank you.

193
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
VANASHA: I like the way you grip it.

194
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:42,136
UTHID: Enough, woman.

195
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:51,049
Nakoa, you came to fight.

196
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,599
How could I not?

197
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,440
During the Red Raids, there was only one
Carja butcher the Nora feared more than Zaid.

198
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,670
Helis.

199
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,379
I would stand against any army he leads, no matter how strong.

200
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:07,609
For the Nora he terrorised, for myself, and for my father.

201
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,950
We'll stop him, you have my word.

202
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,290
Your word means a lot, especially now.

203
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,962
Because of you, I hear the Sacred Land is opened.

204
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,099
If we win, I can go home.

205
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,500
It'll be good to see Yan again.

206
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,375
I'm with you, Aloy, until the end.

207
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,478
NAKOA: Like you said, we'll stop Helis cold, together.

208
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,850
NAKOA: I hear they call you "the anointed" now.

209
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,039
NAKOA: The Matriarchs and their rituals!

210
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,049
NAKOA: Yan's probably eating it up.

211
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:47,838
NAKOA: It's strange to fight alongside the Carja, but I guess they're like any tribe.

212
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,525
NAKOA: Some kind, some vicious.

213
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,730
Janeva, they called you back to duty?

214
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,534
So you're the one behind all this commotion.

215
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:07,950
Who made Sun-King Avad finally show his sword arm from behind those robes.

216
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,467
A king can be fierce and fair, Janeva, he's a good man.

217
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,470
A smart man too.

218
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,571
He had Marad offer all my prisoners a royal pardon if they'd fight for Meridian.

219
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,318
The whole motley lot of them agreed.

220
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,108
Didn't take much convincing.

221
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:25,734
With your kind of convincing, I don't doubt it.

222
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,618
Ha! This time I went easy on them.

223
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:34,519
Those who commit the crime of attacking Meridian,
they'll see less of my lenient side.

224
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,392
May the Sun blaze at your back, Aloy.

225
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,519
JANEVA: Can't fault my prisoners' discipline.

226
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,056
JANEVA: All those dawn drills have served them well.

227
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:48,240
JANEVA: After it's all over I might be
the only one going back to the rock, how'd you like that?

228
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,906
JANEVA: I've waited two years for this war to break, I can wait a little longer.

229
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:08,078
GUARD 1: Isn't that him, from the battle of the Daunt?

230
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:12,680
GUARD 2: Can't be. Cinnabar Sands was before that, and there were no survivors.

231
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,584
NIL: Well, I don't like to boast…

232
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:18,349
GUARD 1: O Sun, keep the shadow from falling upon me.

233
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,089
NIL: Killed anyone lately you'd like to talk about?

234
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,180
Nil?!

235
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:35,967
Aloy, they told me your name.

236
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:40,437
I said "hair like a splash of blood, tenacious as a Scrapper's jaws".

237
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
I've thought about what you said.

238
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,180
Every time the wound you gave me caught in my ribs.

239
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,299
But I didn't wound you.

240
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,390
Not by metal, still, I forgive.

241
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,889
A duel is such a fleeting joy.

242
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,259
If one of us had ended the other, we'd have missed all this.

243
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,942
The wait before blood is shed, like the scrape of a blade across your teeth.

244
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:07,380
Nil, you're making it difficult to be glad to see you.

245
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,667
But you're needed, the battle will be hard.

246
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,869
Hard? I was assured the odds would be near impossible.

247
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,559
And you signed up anyway?

248
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,915
Impossible odds, fine company, killing without consequence, how could I resist?

249
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,568
NIL: I don't care for fighting machines,
but I hear these ones are demons, that's exciting.

250
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,799
NIL: Trouble with a battle is it can be hard to find killing to call your own.

251
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,589
ALOY: Petra!

252
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,160
Here she is, the guest of honour!

253
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,176
I knew there was something about you.

254
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,078
Hammered from the stuff they make leaders out of.

255
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,549
And I don't say that to every Nora girl who blows through my town.

256
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,400
That happens to you a lot?

257
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,680
Ha! Had to build a wall to fend them off.

258
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,490
Good thing I'm persistent then.

259
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,349
Ha, I've missed our little talks.

260
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,108
Marad asked me to look over the city arsenal.

261
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:22,043
These guns have aged well.

262
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:24,300
That runs in the Oseram, no?

263
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,439
They were the pride of the Mainspring forges.

264
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,660
So I've taken greater pride in improving them.

265
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,109
Can I try one?

266
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,690
Everybody wants a turn, have at it then!

267
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,890
The targets should put up a little less of a fight than those bandit raiders did.

268
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,955
PETRA: Range is good, try the next.

269
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:00,480
PETRA: With these, I think we could hold off an army.

270
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,579
PETRA: See? That'll knock a machine on it's ass, ancient or no.

271
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,069
PETRA: No need to aim it like a bow.

272
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,519
You know that I appreciate your help, Petra.

273
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,349
This battle, I…

274
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
I don't know what's gonna happen.

275
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,445
We'll see each other again, I know it.

276
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,457
Next time could be the time I'll convince you to stick with the Free Heap.

277
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:44,884
Petra, you know I c—

278
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,819
PETRA: I don't make weapons for a living, it's more of a diversion.

279
00:29:55,579 --> 00:30:00,000
PETRA: The city always ground my gears but I'd miss it if it were gone.

280
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,519
PETRA: You take care, of yourself and the cannons.

281
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,549
ALOY: Aratak?

282
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,759
I didn't expect you to come all this way.

283
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,002
It's true I am a stranger in this green and snowless land.

284
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:53,511
Ourea forgave the Carja, but I never did.

285
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,068
Still, I was compelled to come for my once chieftain.

286
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,109
It's good to see you leading again.

287
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,916
ARATAK: This one, of no werak, he may have taken too many blows to the head.

288
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,880
ARATAK: But he's a good fighter and strong.

289
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,228
ARATAK: This young icehunter seeks to prove herself also.

290
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:19,460
ARATAK: Her spark reminds me of Ourea's in our youth.

291
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,259
And I'm proud to take my place behind you on this hunt.

292
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:24,618
A great challenge.

293
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,589
Survive and prevail, right?

294
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,900
There is no other way.

295
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:33,685
ARATAK: Did we not fight back machine demons before?

296
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,660
ARATAK: You, my sister, and I?

297
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,549
ARATAK: The battle looms, but every day brings a fresh battle.

298
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,500
ARATAK: CYAN says she could not predict the outcome.

299
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,711
ARATAK: If she had, I would have chosen not to hear it.

300
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,779
Have you come to defend my honour, Inatut?

301
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:00,369
I know you don't need any help with that,
but from all I've heard you've found yourself a good fight here.

302
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,629
So I'll stand this ground with you.

303
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,009
You won't have ever seen a fight like this.

304
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,889
And we only get one shot at it.

305
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,639
I've been told I'm in over my head before, Nora girl.

306
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,249
You know what I say?

307
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm always in over my head.

308
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,349
INATUT: That icehunter doesn't talk much, except to herself.

309
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,627
INATUT: I'm ready! You wanna punch my guts to see how ready I am? No?

310
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,450
INATUT: I choose my own battles now, and I choose this one.

311
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,880
You are the hunter from the Banuk grove.

312
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,980
I remember you also, Nora.

313
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,739
The machines shook free of their slumber after you arrived, raged and fought.

314
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,519
Uh, well, that–that wasn't my fault.

315
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,253
No, I'm thanking you!

316
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:54,450
That night I decided I would not go back to Ban-Ur.

317
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,059
I would take my hunt into these lands.

318
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:03,518
So many machines, even demons,
spidery, skittering, without the blue light in them.

319
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,650
Dead things that must be killed again.

320
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:08,199
Our enemy's dug up an army of them.

321
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,129
An army? Yes! That's why I came.

322
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:15,667
Good, I'll wait.

323
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:19,476
ALUKI: From their metal bones I'll make my armour and my song.

324
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,950
ALUKI: My spear is sharp, my will is like the oldest ice.

325
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,289
ALUKI: If I live, or die, they'll call my name down glacier cracks.

326
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,138
Talanah, why are you here?

327
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,688
I'm your Hawk, where else would I be?

328
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,900
Defending Meridian with Avad?

329
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:28,969
I leave that to the rest of the Lodge.

330
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,179
I will not stand aside while one of mine fights alone.

331
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,719
Not again.

332
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,033
Are you sure, you—

333
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,362
You're risking your life for all of us.

334
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,079
You can't ask me to stand by and watch.

335
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,349
Not when I have the power to change it.

336
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,159
Then I won't ask you.

337
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,247
It's settled, I will fight by your side.

338
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,179
My only request…

339
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,460
Name it.

340
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,349
Leave the biggest machine for me.

341
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,518
No promises.

342
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,269
TALANAH: When you need me, I'll follow your lead.

343
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,962
TALANAH: I came prepared, I have arrows enough to take down five armies.

344
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,400
TALANAH: Hawk and Thrush ready for the battle to start.

345
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,340
BRAVE 1: It rises taller than the highest tree.

346
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,528
BRAVE 2: These Carja in their frilled armour look like turkeys.

347
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,012
BRAVE 3: But there are so many, and now we are so few.

348
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,814
BRAVE 1: They are not our foe, not this time.

349
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,794
SONA: Quiet now, she comes.

350
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:20,487
BRAVE 3: The Anointed!

351
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,599
ALOY: War Chief Sona.

352
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:33,760
War Chief, you… you seem uncomfortable.

353
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,700
The Nora do not belong here, I do not belong here.

354
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,900
I will fight the Metal Devil that threatens us all
but my place is in the Sacred Land.

355
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,340
The wrongness here jags at me like an arrowhead.

356
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,699
I'm sorry to put you through this.

357
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,239
Do not be sorry.

358
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:56,800
This will be ended. My spear, my word.

359
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:00,205
SONA: The Carja do not impress me.

360
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:04,710
SONA: To build so tall is to invite the fate of the ancients.

361
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,860
SONA: We will stand tall for we are the strength of the Nora!

362
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,391
SONA: Your fight is ours, you know it to be so.

363
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:38,869
NAMMAN: O Great Sun, how does your gaze fall?

364
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,119
NAMMAN: In approval or reproach?

365
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:51,039
NAMMAN: Turn our heads with your daily pilgrimage, 
from the east where we came, to the west where only you may go.

366
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,599
NAMMAN: You grant cold metal the warmth of life
and let the machines bask in Your great shining.

367
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,352
NAMMAN: For You the shadows shrink and part
and gather again only at Your allowance, without form.

368
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:11,139
NAMMAN: Your eyes the day,
your ears the priests, your lips the Radiant Sun-King.

369
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:15,952
NAMMAN: As there was before and will be again, Your Light.

370
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,127
ALOY: Namman.

371
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:22,780
I should have known if there was gonna be a Sun Priest here it would be you.

372
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:29,070
And if the Sun-King had allowed outlanders
to set foot upon the Alight, this "Aloy" could only be you.

373
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:35,530
I wish the circumstances were different,
or that the Psalms of the Sun could give you peace of mind.

374
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,122
But if you allow me one pontification…?

375
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:40,159
Go ahead.

376
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,030
You've shown strength and compassion, our enemies only a desperate hate.

377
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,478
Both sides claim the blessing of the Sun, but the Sun that I pray to?

378
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,869
He would bestow it upon yours.

379
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:59,860
You know, Namman, I'm already under
some pretty heavy divine pressure, but I'll try to live up to it.

380
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,086
The tribes united against shadow, how could that not be the Sun's will?

381
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,320
NAMMAN: From what I could gather
the Nora believe their Goddess chose them for a fated battle.

382
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,436
BRAVE: It is an honour.

383
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,165
VARL: Greetings, Aloy.

384
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,599
Don't.

385
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,067
You don't need to bow, The Anointed doesn't like it.

386
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,230
She doesn't much like being called anointed either.

387
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,070
It means a lot to have you here, Varl.

388
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,519
I gave my word.

389
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,889
So, Meridian, what do you think?

390
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,230
I've seen many new things since I first met you.

391
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,020
I should thank you.

392
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,380
Varl, what's wrong?

393
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,880
You really want to know?

394
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,429
Alright.

395
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:11,250
I'm in a foreign land, a tainted land, defending a faithless city
that looks like nothing I've seen, from something I can't imagine.

396
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,500
And you, after all that's happened, all you've done…

397
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,838
I feel like I should drop to my knees and worship you.

398
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,315
But I know you don't want that.

399
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,630
Boy, things are pretty tough for you, huh?

400
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,088
Thanks for telling the other Nora not to bow.

401
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,929
It's the last thing I need.

402
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:31,820
[laughs] Don't be too hard on them.

403
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,820
They only joined this fight because The Anointed bid it so.

404
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,389
Is that why you came?

405
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,320
No.

406
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,150
I would have come just to see you one more time.

407
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:48,257
And we must fight a Metal Devil because the Goddess says, or because you say.

408
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:52,377
I think the Goddess and I are in agreement, we're both glad you're here.

409
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,860
So am I.

410
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,385
VARL: Your friend, the Vanguard keeps looking over.

411
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,702
VARL: Up here I'm not sure if the world has grown bigger, or I've grown smaller.

412
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,226
VARL: I apologise for the War Chief, she is hating this.

413
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,219
VANGUARD 2: So who are these guys?

414
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,309
EREND: They call themselves the Eclipse.

415
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,619
VANGUARD 2: What does that even mean?

416
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,000
EREND: It's when the moon gets in front of the sun, idiot.

417
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,429
VANGUARD 2: Is that supposed to sound scary or something?

418
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,448
VANGUARD 1: I don't know, they used to be Carja.

419
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:57,514
VANGUARD 1: Carja are always yammering about sun and shade.

420
00:42:57,514 --> 00:43:00,920
VANGUARD 2: Well, if they used to be Carja, how tough can they be?

421
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,110
VANGUARD 3: Yeah, their best guys dress like birds.
We'll rip their little feathers off.

422
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,809
EREND: Let's not get cocky, boys.

423
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,809
EREND: Aloy, so here we are again, gearing up for a fight.

424
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,610
Only this time it sounds like the bad guys have a lot more firepower.

425
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,587
What are we up against, really?

426
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,980
I'm not sure, but there's gonna be a lot of them and they'll have machines.

427
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:33,510
And if they get past us, it's not just Meridian that will fall.

428
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,960
The rest of the world will go with it.

429
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:38,664
That's … big.

430
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,095
It sounds like our kind of fight, right guys?

431
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:45,744
Where do they put the Vanguard?

432
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:47,849
At the front of the line!

433
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,474
And why?

434
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:51,179
Steel before iron!

435
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,219
And what are we gonna do?

436
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,098
Hit 'em like a hammer 'til they can't hit back!

437
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,199
Damn right!

438
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,809
You hear that?

439
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,788
Nobody's getting past the Vanguard.

440
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:02,300
We're here from Meridian.

441
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:06,099
And we're here for you.

442
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,929
Thank you, Erend.

443
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,500
Ersa would be proud.

444
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,949
Only if we win.

445
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,690
VANGUARD 2: We gonna fight soon? I'm getting hungry.

446
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,599
VANGUARD 1: You're always hungry.

447
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,550
EREND: Feasts on me after we win.

448
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,869
VANGUARD 2: Beer too?

449
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:23,320
EREND: Beer too.

450
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:26,239
EREND: You just can't leave me alone, can you?

451
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,949
VANGUARD 2: I think she likes you.

452
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,088
VANGUARD 1: You gonna kiss her, Captain?

453
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,008
EREND: Shut up! Now!

454
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:35,599
EREND: We'll just pretend that never happened.

455
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,909
GUARD: —day, citizen.

456
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:04,570
GUARD: Don't ask me where to go if you're lost, I'm a guard, not the town crier.

457
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:13,829
CARJA: —not let Meridian fall without a fight.

458
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:42,790
CARJA: Rally Carja! Do not let Meridian fall!

459
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:27,722
OSERAM: Tell you what I like, the sound of a hammer on steel.

461

ALOY: Olin's apartment.

ALOY: Feels … empty.

474
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:10,798
ALOY: Should I sleep?

475
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,929
ALOY: Did I leave anything unfinished?

476
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:02,482
How could you sleep Elisabet, with a weight like this pressing on you?

477
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:08,797
How did you Rost, after you lost your family?

478
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,679
Sylens? Are you there?

479
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,534
Guess I shouldn't ask ghosts for advice.
