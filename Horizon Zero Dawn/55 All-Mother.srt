1
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,050
HELIS: Oh, speaking of sacrifice, I forgot to tell you.

2
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:32,482
HELIS: After you crashed the Eclipse network, I sent messengers into the east.

3
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:37,149
To rally the forces there and mount an invasion of the "sacred land".

4
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,670
I ordered every Nora killed.

5
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:48,740
I was hoping to catch you there, but, alas, it all seems to have been unnecessary.

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,133
Why butcher dozens of innocents for no gain? It's a waste of effort.

7
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,634
You're right. I won't even be there to enjoy it.

8
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,990
The Nora cast me out at birth.

9
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,149
You're not hurting me if you hurt them.

10
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,827
Really? Then it makes no difference one way or another.

11
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,049
More Eclipse.

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,789
It's a Corrupted Thunderjaw, alright.

13
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,434
The survivors must be holed up in the mountain.

14
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:19,788
If the tunnel collapses, they'll be buried.

15
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,489
And I'll never reach the hatch.

16
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,290
ECLIPSE: That's right, bring down the mountain!

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,300
SONA: Braves! To Aloy's side, now!

18
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,903
VARL: For Aloy!

19
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:51,411
SONA: For the Goddess!
BRAVES: For All-Mother! Raaa!

20
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,540
ALOY: Varl, and Sona. They're still alive.

21
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,843
BRAVE: Faithless and forsaken, you will die!

22
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,734
BRAVE: The corruption will not take hold!

23
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,289
BRAVE: Back to the tainted earth, demon!

24
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,700
BRAVE: May the Goddess remember!

25
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,931
BRAVE: Faithless and forsaken, you will die!

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,357
SONA: Destroy it!

27
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,000
BRAVE: Back to the tainted earth, demon!

28
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,775
BRAVE: The corruption will not take hold!

29
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:10,000
SONA: Strike it down!

30
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:12,953
ALOY: Gotta switch weapons.

31
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,661
BRAVE: May the Goddess remember!

32
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
BRAVE: May the Goddess remember!

33
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,779
SONA: Bring down the demon!

34
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,010
ALOY: FINISH THEM!

35
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,343
BRAVE: We did it!

36
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,497
[cheering]
VARL: Aloy did it, we only helped.

37
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,184
[cheering]
BRAVE: I thought we would die.

38
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,139
VARL: Aloy, your deeds re-enact the old stories.

39
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,250
VARL: Another metal devil struck down upon the slopes.

40
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,269
VARL: If you hadn't returned, the tribe would have been lost.

41
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,850
VARL: You saved the tribe.

42
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,003
Did what no Brave or War-Chief could do.

43
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm glad to see you're alright Varl.

44
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,399
You are alright?

45
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,120
Bruises pale, bones heal.

46
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,062
Don't give me a hunting song, Varl. Are you okay?

47
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,140
My body aches but it's nothing that will keep me from fighting.

48
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:46,067
So much death; is the killing over?

49
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:51,839
For now, but this was just one battle, Varl. There are more to come.

50
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,850
I see.

51
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,765
So long as we have you to fight with us, I suppose we'll make do.

52
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,250
How many survived the attack?

53
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,430
Nearly all the Matriarchs and many families, Goddess be praised.

54
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,250
But Braves? Just a few, and most of them are wounded.

55
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,990
Never before has an enemy stabbed the heart of our people like this.

56
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,069
Even the Carja, in all their Red Raids, never broke through to the Embrace.

57
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,449
Well, this enemy may have broken through, but they never got back out.

58
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,239
We made sure of that.

59
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,790
They struck from the east.

60
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,209
Our sentinels saw the killers coming.

61
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:34,949
Said that beside them marched Deathbringers
and Corruptors and other machines driven mad.

62
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,019
We took ground, met them with clouds of arrows.

63
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,050
Some fell, but they kept coming.

64
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,250
Finally, we withdrew to the gates of the Embrace to make our stand.

65
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,149
But they were too much for us.

66
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,100
Those who survived fell back to the mountain.

67
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,350
By law, only Matriarchs are allowed inside.

68
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,609
It was Teersa who broke the taboo, ordered the tribe into the mountain for safety.

69
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,332
Lansra, well, she didn't agree.

70
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,867
But I don't think anyone heard her over all the screams and shouting.

71
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,452
Teersa's decision saved lives.

72
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:14,519
Good for her, common sense isn't always so common around here.

73
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,649
The Matriarchs will be eager to see you.

74
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,834
I'm sure, but I didn't come here for them.

75
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,149
Then what for?

76
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,379
You will see.

77
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,957
BRAVE: My sons. Oh, Goddess, my poor boys.

78
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:26,284
[coughing]

79
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,663
NORA: How did she know? How is she here?

80
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,250
RESH: You.

81
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,534
Hello, Resh. Still guarding the latrine?

82
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,300
[growls]

83
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,350
ALOY: Teb?!

84
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,113
TEB: Aloy! Oh, you've returned!

85
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,689
Have you travelled far as a Seeker?

86
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,600
You wouldn't believe the things I've seen, Teb.

87
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,649
I'm glad to see you.

88
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,090
Your injuries, are they serious?

89
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,750
A gash or two.

90
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,240
Nothing I couldn't sew back together with a needle and thread.

91
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,950
Guess being a Stitcher came in handy in combat after all, huh?

92
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,679
[laughs] Yes, I suppose it did.

93
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,350
TEB: You should speak to the High Matriarchs, they're waiting.

94
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,760
YAN: Aloy, I don't know how you survived out there.

95
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,806
YAN: Not even Nakoa could have done that.

96
00:10:55,806 --> 00:11:01,759
YAN: Things were easier for a time, once I knew Nakoa was safe.

97
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,850
YAN: But then this happened.

98
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,436
YAN: The goddess must be angry with us, Aloy, for our sins.

99
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,250
ARANA: Aloy, remember us?

100
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,149
I brought Mother's spear with us.

101
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,739
Everything else we had to leave behind.

102
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,100
Glad to see you have it, I know what it means to you.

103
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,100
I hope the enhancement to your spear has proved useful.

104
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,867
Oh, yes. Many times over.

105
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,510
OLARA: Aloy, you've returned.

106
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,129
OLARA: I brought Brom here when the invaders attacked, we barely made it.

107
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:51,693
OLARA: Teersa declared all Nora
welcome to take shelter in the Sacred Mountain, even outcasts.

108
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:57,972
OLARA: Brom has been having some difficulty,
but he'll do better now that the explosions have stopped.

109
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,490
TEERSA: Aloy, you've come back.

110
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,559
JEZZA: The Seeker has returned.

111
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,303
NORA: All-Mother, bless this day
and guide me that we would live on in your memory.

112
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,444
JUN: The outcast girl. You taught me a lesson.

113
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,950
JUN: I've remembered what you said many times, I think I'm better for it.

114
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,894
JUN: I was lucky to make it here alive.

115
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,649
JUN: The invasion was terrifying to behold.

116
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,820
JUN: I brought extra stores of Dreamwillow.

117
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:41,429
JUN: May the Goddess watch over you.

118
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,860
NORA: The machines of the faithless slaughtered our people.

119
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,990
FIA: Aloy! I'm glad to see you again.

120
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,247
FIA: The Dreamwillow you recovered
has comforted many who were wounded in the attack.

121
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,049
FIA: May the Goddess protect.

122
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,629
TEERSA: Come, speak to us.

123
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,757
LANSRA: Foolish woman. You welcome a curse.

124
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,599
JEZZA: Come, Seeker, we have much to discuss.

125
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,179
LANSRA: Her very presence here is a blasphemy.

126
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,658
TEERSA: So you have finally returned.

127
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,514
LANSRA: Pfft!

128
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:21,563
She not only returned but fought her way through many enemies to reach us.

129
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:24,470
Outside, she brought low a Corrupted Thunderjaw.

130
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,079
She lifted the siege.

131
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,339
JEZZA: How was this done?

132
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,862
By the will of All-Mother.

133
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,200
Have you returned to speak with the goddess, Aloy?

134
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,170
Um, yes, I guess you could say that.

135
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,125
I think it'll work this time.

136
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:45,094
Sisters! Surely we cannot permit this!

137
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:49,502
Because of her, our tribe teeters upon extinction.

138
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:53,240
What if she has come to wake her father, the Metal Devil?

139
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,089
She means to finish our destruction!

140
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,249
We must stop her!

141
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,960
LANSRA: She is a curse made flesh.

142
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,798
LANSRA: She will be the end.

143
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,649
ALOY: I fought my way past an army while you cowered in this cave.

144
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,750
You really think you can stop me?

145
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,179
It's time to step aside.

146
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,179
I'm not gonna hurt you.

147
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:20,090
If there's anything I've learned since the Proving,
it's that there are bigger evils in this world than you.

148
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,340
COMPUTER: Hold for Identiscan.

149
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,960
COMPUTER: Error. Alpha Registry corrupted.

150
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,919

COMPUTER: Greetings Doctor Sobeck, you are cleared to proceed.

153
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,018
COMPUTER: Welcome to Eleuthia cradle 9, brood 1.

154
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,624
SYLENS, THROUGH FOCUS: I see you're inside.

155
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:38,480
ALOY: Figured I might be hearing from you.

156
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,230
SYLENS: Shall we begin?

157
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:41,990
ALOY: I never stopped.

158
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,119
ALOY: So these are artificial wombs?

159
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,950
SYLENS: The mothers of a new generation, hundreds of years ago.

160
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,259
ALOY: And me.

161
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,067
ALOY: So this was it.

162
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,099
SYLENS: Where you were born.

163
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,380
ALOY: But … but why?

164
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,318
MULTISERVITOR: Another day has passed.

165
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,660
GIRL: You mean the lights got dim.

166
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,828
BOY: I don't want to sleep, Mother.

167
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:02,549
MULTISERVITOR: I know. But it is time to get some rest.

168
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,401
BOY: No, I'm king today, what I say goes!

169
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:10,009
GIRL: I want to see the real sun, not lights and pictures.

170
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:12,320
MULTISERVITOR: You will in time, children.

171
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,963
CHILDREN: In time! In time! In time! In time!

172
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:21,429
GIRL: [screams]

173
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,450
ALOY: These look like cribs.

174
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,566
SYLENS: The cradles of a Cradle facility.

175
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:24,598
ALOY: And those things, the–the multiservitors, they took care of them.

176
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,220
SYLENS: There was no-one else.

177
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,759
MALE: "Someday"? That's what you always say. 

178
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,808
LENA: We want it now!

179
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,745
MALE: It's big down there!

180
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,063
LENA: Now, Father!

181
00:21:57,063 --> 00:22:00,259
MULTISERVITOR: Children, that area is not yet available.

182
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,368
MALE: Get him!

183
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:03,880
MULTISERVITOR: Physical aggression detected.

184
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,027
MULTISERVITOR: Physical aggression is not permitted.

185
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,784
LENA: Except yours.

186
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:11,507
MALE: Damn sentinels.

187
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,325
MULTISERVITOR: Children, may I be of assistance?

188
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,561
MALE: Go away, healer.

189
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,577
MULTISERVITOR: Lena, you have suffered mild bruising.

190
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:19,248
LENA: Go away!

191
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,970
So this is where they lived?

192
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,748
It's a mess, everything's broken or painted on.

193
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,160
How long did they live here?

194
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,073
MULTISERVITOR: Children, let's run and jump and blow off steam!

195
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,639
FEMALE: Leave us alone, Father.

196
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,569
MULTISERVITOR: After what just happened I can't leave you two alone.

197
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,802
MULTISERVITOR: You broke community rules.

198
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,650
MALE: Just let us talk then.

199
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,186
FEMALE: Go away!

200
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:34,923
MULTISERVITOR: I'm sorry children, but I must provide supervision.

201
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,869
FEMALE: You're not even a person!

202
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,049
MULTISERVITOR: You sound frustrated. Let's run and jump and blow off steam!

203
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,868
MULTISERVITOR: I have no choice but to release you.

204
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,129
FEMALE 1: But why?

205
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,239
MULTISERVITOR: There is no food here anymore.

206
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,368
MALE 2: But there's food out there?

207
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,685
MULTISERVITOR: We don't know for sure.

208
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:32,085
MALE 1: Come on, let's go!

209
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:33,449
FEMALE 1: I don't know.

210
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,000
MALE 2: Mother, can we come back, if we're cold?

211
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,969
MULTISERVITOR: I'm sorry, but that won't be possible.

212
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,269
MULTISERVITOR: You will have to support yourselves now,
and take care of each other.

213
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,798
FEMALE 2: What will happen to you?

214
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,509
MULTISERVITOR: I will stay here and sleep and remember all of you.

215
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,609
FEMALE 1: What will happen to us?

216
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,349
MULTISERVITOR: You will be brave and you will learn.

217
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,915
ALOY: They were trapped here their whole lives.

218
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:05,331
SYLENS: In plain view of luxurious space.

219
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,200
ALOY: What-what went wrong?

220
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,796
ALOY: Why couldn't they access the other areas?

221
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:13,192
SYLENS: Unknown. But you won't have that problem.

222
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:38,189
MALE CHILD: Blue is the colour of the sky.

223
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,644
FEMALE CHILD: White is the colour of clouds.

224
00:25:40,644 --> 00:25:43,389
MALE CHILD: Yellow is the colour of the sun.

225
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,818
FEMALE CHILD: Green is the colour of grass.

226
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:49,009
MALE CHILD: Flowers can be any colour, take a look.

227
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:52,368
FEMALE CHILD: Bees are yellow and black and they love flowers.

228
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:59,595
FEMALE CHILD: Here they come! Bzz, bzz, bzzzzz… [laughter]

229
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,170
ALOY: Looks like they didn't like this door very much.

230
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,147
SYLENS: It wouldn't open for them, of course they hated it.

231
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,656
COMPUTER: Hold for Identiscan.

232
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,900
COMPUTER: Genetic identity confirmed. Entry authorised.

233
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,289
COMPUTER: Welcome to the Lyceum, a place of learning.

234
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,783
COMPUTER: Greetings, Dr Sobeck.

235
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,380
ALOY: So what was this place, exactly?

236
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:48,130
SYLENS: The dream of Apollo, never realised.

237
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,450
ALOY: But why not?

238
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,285
COMPUTER: Welcome students.

239
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:13,720
COMPUTER: Please pick up a Focus device
and place it on the side of your head, just behind your eye.

240
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,049
SYLENS: I had to dredge the pits of the world looking for Focuses to repair.

241
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,930
SYLENS: And here sat a trove, enreaching no-one.

242
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,686
SAMINA EBADJI: Hello, child, my name is Samina.

243
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,899
SAMINA EBADJI: Today is a big day.

244
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,960
SAMINA EBADJI: Your first day of school.

245
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,590
SAMINA EBADJI: There's so much for you to learn,
so much promise and possibility.

246
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,474
COMPUTER: Alert. Malfunction. Apollo offline.

247
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:48,683
ALOY: "Apollo offline"?

248
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:53,543
SYLENS: You were right, Aloy, this is a graveyard.

249
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:55,940
SYLENS: The charnel house of knowledge.

250
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,508
SYLENS: What we might have achieved, had we not been denied it.

251
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:04,140
ALOY: Maybe there's a way to fix it. But it's not why I came here.

252
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,650
SYLENS: Of course.

253
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,850
SYLENS: What's the whole of human knowledge
next to the origin of one girl?

254
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,849
SYLENS: Continue your search.

255
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,720
ALOY: I will.

256
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,027
SAMINA EBADJI: Hello, child, my name is Samina.

257
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,159
SAMINA EBADJI: Today is a big day.

258
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,220
SAMINA EBADJI: Your first day of school.

259
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:31,759
SAMINA EBADJI: There's so much for you to learn,
so much promise and possibility.

260
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,735
COMPUTER: Alert. Malfunction. Apollo offline.

261
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,210
SAMINA EBADJI: Hello, child, my name is Samina.

262
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,169
SAMINA EBADJI: Today is a big day.

263
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,230
SAMINA EBADJI: Your first day of school.

264
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,787
SAMINA EBADJI: There's so much for you to learn,
so much promise and possibility.

265
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:25,794
COMPUTER: Alert. Malfunction. Apollo offline.

266
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,993
COMPUTER: Brood 1 control accessed.

267
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:43,630
COMPUTER: Priority message for Dr Sobeck. Please scan message with Focus.

268
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,549
ALOY: That sounds important.

269
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,831
SYLENS: Yes. I suspect we're about to learn a great deal.

270
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,694
COMPUTER: Identiscan malfunction. Present credentials.

271
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,000
GAIA: Elisabet.

272
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,028
This message serves to inform you of an unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly.

273
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:33,140
Three microseconds ago the Gaia Prime facility
received a data transmission of unknown origin.

274
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:41,311
Its immediate effect was to transform my subordinate functions into
unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature.

275
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,953
What?

276
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:51,215
Thus awakened, the Hades function will now
seize control of the terraforming system and reverse operations.

277
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:55,429
Rendering life on Earth extinct in 53.8 days.

278
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,950
For obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur.

279
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:05,880
And so before Hades can take control,
I am ordering Gaia Prime's reactor to overload.

280
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,809
The resulting explosion will destroy Hades.

281
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,759
Unfortunately, it will destroy me as well.

282
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:22,881
While this admittedly desperate course of action will
avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain in peril.

283
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:30,000
With no central governing intelligence to regulate the terraforming system
it will continue operations for some time.

284
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,950
But in an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually it will break down.

285
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:38,368
Does she mean the Derangement?

286
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,298
You are my solution.

287
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:50,660
I have ordered this Cradle facility to use genetic material in cryostorage
to gestate a reinstantiation of Elisabet Sobeck, my creator.

288
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:57,544
While high level directives forbid me from
communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility,

289
00:31:57,544 --> 00:32:02,899
all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical maturity.

290
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:12,439
Whereupon your geneprint will allow you to re-enter this facility,
obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this message.

291
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:23,079
Likewise, your geneprint will allow you to enter other facilities and over time,
harness their technologies to rebuild the system core and reboot Gaia.

292
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:28,278
A moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate, and unanticipated.

293
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:40,000
In response to my act of self-destruction, Hades has launched a virus
to dissolve the code shackles that hold it, that hold all of them, in place.

294
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,849
It— they are escaping.

295
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,019
But to where?

296
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,941
The virus is corrupting data throughout the system. What if—

297
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:55,239
Oh. The Alpha Registry at the Cradle facility is one of the files corrupted.

298
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,900
But if that is so, the door will never open for you.

299
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,098
You will never view this message.

300
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:05,712
Then I have failed and life will end.

301
00:33:06,844 --> 00:33:09,699
No, Elisabet, I know you too well.

302
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,380
Somehow you will find a way, in you all things are possible.

303
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,899
Go to the ruins of Gaia Prime,
find the control room, and within it the master override.

304
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,433
This will give you the power to purge Hades so long as you find a way to wield it.

305
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:31,238
Do not attempt repair of the system core until Hades is eradicated.

306
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:33,808
Hades must be destroyed.

307
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:34,950
That is all.

308
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,160
I only wish that I could hear your voice again.

309
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:55,549
SYLENS: So … you're even more extraordinary than I thought.

310
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,749
ALOY: I never had a mother.

311
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,394
SYLENS: What are you talking about?
You had two, a dead woman and a machine.

312
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:10,000
ALOY: I'm not a person, I'm an instrument, manufactured by a machine.

313
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,528
ALOY: Born in destruction and fire.

314
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,438
SYLENS: To quench the flames and heal the world.

315
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,119
SYLENS: How tragic to learn you're a person of towering importance.

316
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,608
SYLENS: It seems you have a destiny to fulfil.

317
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,655
SYLENS: So when you're done feeling sorry for yourself, go to the Bitter Climb.

318
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:31,599
SYLENS: I'll be waiting above in Gaia Prime's ruins.

319
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,579
COMPUTER: Identiscan malfunction rectified.

320
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,314
COMPUTER: Eleuthia 9 brood 1 access unsealed.

321
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:45,408
ALOY: This is going to be interesting.

322
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,987
LANSRA: Aloy! Forgive! Forgive!

323
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,068
TEERSA: The Goddess spoke to you?

324
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,320
ALOY: Uh, s-she did.

325
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,579
What did she say?

326
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:24,134
That I–I was born to lift a curse, to kill a metal demon.

327
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,343
How Aloy, how?

328
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:28,009
I don't know yet.

329
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:30,410
But she told me where to go to find out.

330
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,260
And you will do this?

331
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:39,818
It was her wish, what she made me for.

332
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:44,449
Yes, I will do it.

333
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,829
I'll try anyway.

334
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:52,699
JEZZA, LANSRA: All praise Aloy, anointed of the Nora!

335
00:38:52,699 --> 00:39:01,163
JEZZA, LANSRA: All praise Aloy, anointed of the Nora!
ALOY: No, no, stop this. Up! Up! Up.

336
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,389
First you shun me, now this?

337
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,588
I will not be worshipped!

338
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,588
I'm not your "anointed"!

339
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,429
I don't belong to you!

340
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,908
There's a whole world beyond your borders.

341
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,440
Whole tribes of people just as good as you.

342
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,179
And it is all in danger.

343
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,699
It's a world worth fighting for, not just here, everywhere.

344
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,769
How can we help?

345
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:41,100
If you can fight and you're willing, go to Meridian and wait for me there.

346
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,837
As Aloy says, so it shall be.

347
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,593
JEZZA: Nora, make way for Aloy!
LANSRA: Make way!

348
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:53,639
TEERSA: Make way, that she may forge the path for others to follow.

349
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:29,267
There can be no doubt now, you are
a blessing made flesh, the will of the Goddess incarnate.

350
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,408
It's really not that simple Teersa, but I guess it's close enough.

351
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:38,239
I know the path ahead will be dangerous.

352
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:44,206
To kill a metal devil sounds impossible, but I believe in you.

353
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,000
The Nora have suffered terrible losses Teersa, what's to become of them now?

354
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:55,136
That will be for the Goddess to decide, only she knows the future.

355
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,130
For the moment my sister Matriarchs and I will see to the wounded.

356
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:08,460
And as I promised anyone who wishes to join you
at Meridian, we will declare Seekers.

357
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:14,522
Teersa, I want to know Rost's story.

358
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:16,659
Why he was made an outcast.

359
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,404
He never told me, said he took an oath of silence.

360
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,239
What did he do?

361
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:27,552
Oh, yes, that.

362
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,864
What crime did he commit?

363
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,076
I will tell you if you wish.

364
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:38,309
But it is a long story, are you sure you want to hear it now?

365
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:42,389
Of course I want to hear it, tell me.

366
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:47,834
Rost never committed any crime, he was an outcast by choice.

367
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,000
What? What do you mean?

368
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,744
Many years ago, before the derangement, before the Red Raids…

369
00:41:55,744 --> 00:42:01,510
a band of murderous outlanders, twelve in number, struck without warning

370
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,919
At Mother's Vigil they took hostages.

371
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:08,467
And then pressed on, headed for Devil's Thirst.

372
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,800
Mother's Vigil? Where's that?

373
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,250
You would know it as the forsaken village, near the Carja border.

374
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,920
But at the time many families lived there.

375
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,929
Rosts's was one of them.

376
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:29,010
His mate was killed fighting the outlanders,
and his daughter was among those taken hostage.

377
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,399
His daughter?

378
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:35,227
W-w-what was her name?

379
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:39,920
Alana. She was just six years old.

380
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,480
Nora Braves couldn't stop twelve outlanders or rescue the hostages?

381
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,550
It was quite impossible.

382
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:55,034
We outnumbered them, but every time a Brave
came within bow shot the outlanders killed a hostage.

383
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,896
What did they come here to do?

384
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:00,809
That was never discovered.

385
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:04,269
We couldn't track closely enough to observe them.

386
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,510
We know they camped beyond Devil's Thirst for two days.

387
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:14,234
There were reports of strange noises.

388
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:22,239
And then, as suddenly as they came,
the outlanders made their way back to the border and disappeared.

389
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,602
What happened to Rost's daughter?

390
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,000
She was killed?

391
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:35,820
Rost was one of the Braves who tracked the outlanders, keeping his distance.

392
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,119
There were six hostages still alive
when they reached the border, Alana among them.

393
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:53,210
Rather than release them, the outlanders
slit their throats and left the corpses just across the border, mocking us.

394
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,300
Why?

395
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,747
Cruelty.

396
00:43:57,747 --> 00:44:04,622
They knew the faithful Nora would not leave the Sacred Land
to collect the bodies, let alone pursue them.

397
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,010
They thought themselves safe from our vengeance.

398
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,434
Are you saying that Rost went after them, that he became an exile?

399
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,500
No. Rost was beside himself with grief,
but even so, he would never have broken taboo.

400
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,130
Then what did he do?

401
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:26,210
He called upon the most terrible and secret rite of the Nora tribe.

402
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,519
He begged to be made a Death-Seeker.

403
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:33,690
A "Death-Seeker"? What is that?

404
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:40,250
One who dies to go seeking, and in seeking brings death to others.

405
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:47,034
The ritual drags the spirit from one's body, releasing it to All-Mother's care.

406
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:52,342
The heart beats, the mind thinks, but the spirit has moved on.

407
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:55,834
I–I don't understand.

408
00:44:55,834 --> 00:45:01,072
Rost went after the outlanders, but his spirit never left.

409
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:04,934
It remained here with All-Mother.

410
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:08,961
He gathered the bodies of the slain and returned them.

411
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:15,465
And then he set out in pursuit, not as an exile, but a weapon of vengeance.

412
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:19,625
A barbed arrow shot from a bow, never to return.

413
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,365
But–but Rost did return.

414
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:30,000
Yes, a full year later, and terribly wounded.

415
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,401
He collapsed at the border of the Sacred Land.

416
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:35,277
A hunting party came upon him.

417
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:39,796
He was delirious, in agony.

418
00:45:40,444 --> 00:45:44,634
By law, he should have died where he lay.

419
00:45:44,634 --> 00:45:51,834
But one of the hunters broke taboo
and reaching across the border, she dragged him to our side.

420
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:53,267
Who was she?

421
00:45:53,267 --> 00:46:00,565
A Brave who'd lost a mate and two sons to the very outlanders that Rost pursued.

422
00:46:00,565 --> 00:46:04,300
So Rost never finished his mission.

423
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,113
To the contrary, he killed all twelve.

424
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:11,058
Tracked them to disparate placess the world over, he said.

425
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:19,725
Meridian, Ban-Ur, The Claim, Utaru land, further even into the Forbidden West.

426
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:23,792
The last he killed nearly got the best of him.

427
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:33,242
Wounded, he stumbled and crawled back to us,
hoping to die as close to the Sacred Land as he could.

428
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:40,350
He never expected nor asked to be dragged
across the border and nursed back to health.

429
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:47,283
That was done to him, leaving us, the Matriarchs, in a difficult position.

430
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:49,691
Why couldn't you just welcome him back?

431
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:52,712
Rost had been made a Death-Seeker, Aloy.

432
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:55,723
He no longer had any place among the tribe.

433
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,621
By law, he should have been driven back out.

434
00:47:01,114 --> 00:47:05,690
But we couldn't bring ourselves to do that.

435
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,634
So we offered a compromise.

436
00:47:08,634 --> 00:47:10,364
You made him an outcast?

437
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:19,224
Yes. We offered to do so on the condition
he never speak to anyone of this exception.

438
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:25,197
After all he did, all he suffered, to be declared an outcast was his reward?

439
00:47:25,197 --> 00:47:27,329
Rost was overjoyed.

440
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:35,039
He never expected to live another day in the Sacred Land,
let alone the Embrace so close to the Goddess.

441
00:47:35,513 --> 00:47:41,223
He resolved to spend the rest of his days in solitude and was happy to do so.

442
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:45,885
But then you found me and gave me to him.

443
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,782
Yes, another compromise.

444
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:55,513
The Matriarchs feared you and would not let you be raised by the tribe.

445
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,630
And so we turned to Rost.

446
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:07,044
I knew that he would take care of you, bring you up,
teach you to worship All-Mother, and respect the ways of the tribe.

447
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:10,691
He certainly tried anyway.

448
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:18,569
You took a man who'd lost his daughter and made him raise an infant girl?

449
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:20,929
Doesn't that strike you as callous?

450
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:26,129
I'm inclined to think the course of events has shown the wisdom of our choice.

451
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:36,920
And I'm quite certain that from the moment he laid eyes on you,
he saw you as a gift and never a burden.

452
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:44,362
I thank you for doing what you could to help me through the years,
and for telling me Rost's story.

453
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:49,900
I wish I could have done more, but I am just one woman.

454
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,900
As am I, no need to sell ourselves short.

455
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:57,434
Oh, thank you, Aloy!

456
00:48:58,824 --> 00:49:00,444
I will pray for you.

457
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,500
Okay, I guess it can't hurt.

458
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:10,000
NORA: The Anointed has shown us the goddess's mercy,
but now she will show those murderers justice.

459
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,974
JEZZA: My life has been long, but I've never seen anything like that.

460
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:24,145
JEZZA: Teersa was right, a blessing, not a curse. We were so unsure.

461
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:32,973
JEZZA: I know your quest is dangerous, Aloy, but All-Mother will protect you.

462
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:35,926
ALOY: I don't think it works that way, Jezza.

463
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:39,435
JEZZA: All-Mother has blessed your journey.

464
00:49:41,463 --> 00:49:45,562
SONA: I will lead a War Party to Meridian, you have my word.

465
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,994
ARANA: Aloy! How did you do that?

466
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:52,000
THOK: Shush Arana, she is the Anointed.

467
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,239
We'll go to Meridian, Aloy! I'll bring mother's spear!

468
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,396
Arana!

469
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:58,204
Your father is right.

470
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,267
You belong here, you both do.

471
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:03,776
Thank you, Aloy, for everything you've done.

472
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:06,177
I will make sure Arana is kept safe.

473
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:09,358
Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

474
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,750
OLARA: I saw you go inside and saw you emerge.

475
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,982
OLARA: But it's still hard to believe.

476
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:25,912
OLARA: You were an outcast once, but now I'm not sure what you are.

477
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:32,818
OLARA: May the Goddess protect you on your journeys, Aloy. I will see to Brom.

478
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:47,479
VARL: Aloy, I don't know what to say.

479
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,700
Say that you'll see me at Meridian.

480
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:55,667
Of course, that much is simple, but the rest…

481
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:58,340
Complicated, I know.

482
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,069
But maybe if I took you into the heart of the mountain?

483
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:07,834
No! At least… not yet. I don't know.

484
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:10,000
Please don't think less of me, Aloy.

485
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,479
But the Goddess chose you to see that, not me.

486
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:16,000
Right.

487
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,358
I always knew you weren't like other Nora.

488
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:19,948
Neither are you, Varl.

489
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:26,513
Maybe if we survive all this, I can show you what I've learned.

490
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:27,993
What I'm learning.

491
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:31,285
Perhaps. If the Goddess so wills it.

492
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:33,948
See you in Meridian.

493
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:12,250
Good, another power cell.

494
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,655
If I find more, I should be able to get to that ancient armour I found.

495
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:36,411
NORA: She has destroyed corruption that still spreads through the world.
