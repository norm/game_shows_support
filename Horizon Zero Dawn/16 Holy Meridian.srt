1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,750
[Carja guard]
Don't ask me where to go if you're lost…

2
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,250
[Carja outlander]
…seasoned tourist, but the Banuk deny…

3
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,650
[Carja guard]
…many have died and many more…

4
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,920
[Carja merchant]
I can't help but smile with sunshine.

5
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,360
[Aloy]
Erend said to meet him at the Sun Palace.

6
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,870
[Aloy]
Now might be the time.

7
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,349
[Carja guard]
These damn Oseram stirring up tensions.

8
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,969
[Carja guard]
I'm keeping my eyes open.

9
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,860
[Carja merchant]
Won't cost you a shard just a look.

10
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,315
[Carja merchant]
Don't pass up these goods.

11
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,949
[Carja outlander]
…of all cities and within, the great…

12
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,459
[Carja merchant]
Come take a look, I'll give you a good price.

13
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,759
[Carja outlander]
Hope you're well.

14
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,709
[Carja artisan]
Some Oseram is building…

15
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,770
I may not have all the answers, but there is a book of bylaws here
which can tell you more about the lodge.

16
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:51,080
Umm, suddenly you're a lot nicer.

17
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,239
I saw you talking to Talanah, she's tough.

18
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,990
You'd be lucky to keep up with her, machine rider or no.

19
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,009
Go on and give Ahsis those trophies!

20
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,684
I thought I told you…

21
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:40,436
I'm here to present trophies to the Sunhawk of the Lodge.

22
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:44,860
Three Sawtooths, two Ravagers and a Stalker for good measure.

23
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,879
I suppose Talanah helped you with this.

24
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,350
I brought these down myself.

25
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,139
Will you accept them?

26
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,759
Fine, yes, I accept them.

27
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,360
But tell Talanah she should stop playing with sludge if she wants to get Redmaw.

28
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,389
[Carja outlander]
…that could destroy a village and disappear into the hills.

29
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,629
When I gave him my trophies,

30
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,009
Ahsis said you should be spending more time finding Redmaw than helping me.

31
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,467
That bunghead isn't wrong, but there isn't time to find Redmaw right now.

32
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,239
You're gonna help with something else.

33
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,739
Oh, and what might that be?

34
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,189
Meet me outside.

35
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,743
[Carja outlander]
A little sweat and hard work never hurt anyone.

36
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,739
You want to help?

37
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,338
Here's someone who needs it.

38
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,853
Go ahead Ilsadi.

39
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:47,769
I live in Lone Light, northeast of here.

40
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,360
I barely escaped because Glinthawks attack anyone who ventures out.

41
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,539
We have so few shards.

42
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,949
Will you help? We have nowhere else to turn.

43
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,139
Sometimes members receive an honorarium for the hunt.

44
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,370
Ahsis should have accepted this one, but he refused.

45
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,069
The price was too low.

46
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,589
How generous.

47
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,490
In the past, I would have gone with Tarkas to handle this.

48
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,519
What say you and I take it on?

49
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,240
I'll meet you at Lone Light.

50
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,740
What about Redmaw?

51
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,439
Are you in or not?

52
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,449
Alright.

53
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,899
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

54
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,009
I'll make sure Ilsadi makes it back to Lone Light.

55
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,028
Meet you there?

56
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,759
It's just northeast of here.

57
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,939
[Vilgund]
Able bodied adventurers.

58
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,959
[Vilgund]
Preferably with no friends or family.

59
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,470
[Vilgund]
But I'm not choosy.

60
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,218
Hoy there Outlander!

61
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,949
Name's Vilgund.

62
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,419
Did you come to the city looking for work?

63
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,759
Good shards.

64
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,087
Enough to buy garb, more becoming of your…

65
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,905
Okay, stop there if you want me to hear you out.

66
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:22,649
I only meant a well-molded woman such as you…

67
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,939
[clears throat]

68
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,475
Are you some kind of merchant?

69
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,716
You don't seem to have any wares.

70
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,440
More of an opportunist.

71
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,744
Girl … Nora girl … [clears throat]

72
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,350
Huntress.

73
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,038
We live in a world of opportunities.

74
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,038
Risky opportunities.

75
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,860
But why should risk stand in the way of a lucrative prospect for the likes of me?

76
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,240
Alright, I'm more of a gambler.

77
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,370
I heard an interesting rumour about a Banuk camp.

78
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:56,239
They say the Banuk there live alongside machines.

79
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,289
Peaceful as you like, keep 'em, use 'em, sing to 'em.

80
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,999
If it's true, if we learn how they do it,

81
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,573
think how valuable that would be to all the tribes!

82
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:12,159
When you say valuable, you mean they'd pay you for it.

83
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,038
The last bunch just wanted to know about the reward.

84
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,070
You're a smart one.

85
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,298
I hired men to investigate.

86
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,284
Just investigate, that's all.

87
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:26,736
Those Banuk are canny, too canny.

88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,839
I paid up front.

89
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,893
Well, half up front.

90
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,370
I've had no word back.

91
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,429
So now you're hiring someone to find the last men you hired?

92
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:40,849
Psh. They're a sunk cost.

93
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,836
What can you tell me about the Banuk?

94
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:46,960
Well, the Banuk women, snow witches all.

95
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,183
Cold eyes, cold … [clears throat]

96
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,259
They choose to live up there in Ban-Ur in the ice.

97
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:01,569
Trying to have a conversation, it's like chipping them out of the stuff.

98
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,570
They prefer machines for company.

99
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,970
That's why I'm putting my shards on this rumour.

100
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,139
Then they might not want outsiders to know about this place.

101
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:12,339
Ha!

102
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,939
Their mystic act.

103
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,339
No care for possessions, for luxuries? Pile of slag!

104
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,750
Those people bargain harder than the winter frost.

105
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,716
If I did look into your rumour…

106
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:27,548
You won't need to climb up the shoulders of the world for it!

107
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:32,049
It's on the edge of Banuk land, beneath the Anvil of the Moon.

108
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,320
And you look like you know your way around the Savage East …

109
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,259
… the east.

110
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,625
If it's true, they walk among machines without fear in this camp, well.

111
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:46,370
You can't miss that, can you?

112
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,350
Payment on return.

113
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,169
Irid.

114
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,269
Didn't want to startle you.

115
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,039
Oh, yes.

116
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,418
I heard of the tragedy that befell your tribe.

117
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,570
The Sun hung low that day as we traveled back.

118
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,028
So, this is the temple of the Sun Priests.

119
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:17,839
Where we offer are daily prayers for balance.

120
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,209
I'm afraid only Carja can participate.

121
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,860
But you are welcome to observe.

122
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,159
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

123
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,443
What are these prayers?

124
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:33,706
To recognize the Sun is to recognise we live in renewal.

125
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:38,579
By Its rise and fall we determine what to take up and what to set aside.

126
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,328
Offered to Its pure heat, the skin peels and old time is burned away.

127
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,038
We treasure the blisters.

128
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,970
That sounds … painful.

129
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,026
Well, there is no glory without sacrifice.

130
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,500
The temple looks out on the tower across the valley, why?

131
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:07,819
It is said that the Spire's shadow lay across this mesa
when our ancestors came to the valley searching for a home.

132
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,803
Thus, Sun and Spire joined, showing the Carja where to build.

133
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,538
The dawn of Meridian!

134
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,750
Always illuminating, Irid.

135
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,079
There is a matter not officially sanctioned.

136
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,950
That someone off your boldness…

137
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,269
You don't have to squirm Irid, let's hear it.

138
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,739
Uh, one of our brethren, my friend Namman,
has stepped from the Sun's light in protest.

139
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,850
I've supported his efforts as much as I can, but…

140
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,649
Would you speak with him in the Sun Ring?

141
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,690
I'll see what I can do.

142
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,649
May you always go in light, my friend

143
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:11,440
[distant singing from the Sun Ring]

144
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,799
[Carja noble]
Ha! King Avad's decree brought the Hunters Lodge in line.

145
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,350
[Carja noble]
Hear they had to admit another woman into the ranks.

146
00:14:18,351 --> 00:15:07,940
[singing]

147
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,339
[Carja artisan]
Who's really in charge of Meridian, huh? The Oseram, that's who.

148
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,807
[Carja artisan]
Whispering in our Sun-King's ear.

149
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,269
[Carja outlander]
Captain of the Vanguard, murdered?

150
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:57,590
[singing]

151
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:03,022
[Carja outlander]
Shadow Carja ambushed Captain Ersa, but how did they lure her out there?

152
00:16:03,022 --> 00:17:12,740
[singing]

153
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,960
[Sun Priest]
You're Nora.

154
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,279
I'm the Mournful Namman.

155
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,049
My apologies that we meet like this.

156
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,608
Like this?

157
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,970
In grief. You hold yours close like a talisman.

158
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,358
Wait, forgive me.

159
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,660
You didn't come for reparations?

160
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:35,599
Someone you lost to the Sun Ring?

161
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,210
No, I know about the Red Raids, but the Carja owe me nothing.

162
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:41,460
I see.

163
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,038
Well, I could use the help of a strong-willed outlander.

164
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,759
Then I would owe you very much indeed.

165
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:53,779
I didn't think your priesthood would ask outsiders for help.

166
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,142
If only the Sun would set on our pride.

167
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,269
Until this is done I am no Sun Priest.

168
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:03,359
To wear a red robe was an aspiration.

169
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,180
I aspired.

170
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,859
Now our hoods make us blind.

171
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,559
We whisper reconciliation, but forget how the old King's priests sang the words and blessed the killing.

172
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,769
You're disappointed with the Sun Priests, but you still wanted to be one?

173
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:24,549
I spent my whole life looking up to the temple,
my brother's voice echoing in its arches.

174
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,670
Even he couldn't turn me away, and how he tried in the end.

175
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:38,640
He said, "When we were loved, our robes were dyed in cinnabar,
now they are stained in blood."

176
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,769
How so?

177
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,109
Our robes are handed down to us.

178
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,279
Most of the old priests fled rather than be seen in the glare of a new Sun.

179
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,552
And so we left to wear their sins.

180
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:52,779
For me, at least, they hang heavy.

181
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,680
Where is your brother now?

182
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,319
He waits for me on the trail of the Sun, I hope.

183
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,390
He spoke out against the sacrifices.

184
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,754
For a priest to question the Sun-King's will?

185
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,859
His punishment was worst of all.

186
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,160
You lost someone you loved too.

187
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,369
I'm sorry.

188
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,950
No, not lost.

189
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,660
When I took on these robes,

190
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,259
I found his memory.

191
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,609
Why did the priests go along with all that bloodshed?

192
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,670
Sometimes we Carja are more concerned with what is tradition than what is right.

193
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,349
Huh.

194
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,269
Maybe the Carja and Nora aren't so different.

195
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,776
These people seek to honour their loved, their lost, with their own voices.

196
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,950
Not mouthing Carja rituals to Carja stone.

197
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,279
But there are obstacles.

198
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:50,259
While Meridian holds its breath for any disturbance, these robes only tie my hands.

199
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,739
What kind of obstacles?

200
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,569
The first pilgrim is an Oseram,
 who seeks to visit the Shrine of Kings on the road to the city.

201
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,069
He waits there now, forbidden to enter by an old Sun Priest who'll suffer no heathen.

202
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:11,289
This Utaru lost her companion on the edge of the Jewel,
at a pool where Snapmaws gather.

203
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:14,407
A shrine was built their to ward off the machines.

204
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,970
Its effectiveness leaves much to be desired.

205
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,502
And the Banuk would paint a mark on the Sun's Climb.

206
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,527
A call to the machine spirits I understand.

207
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,644
They need no beckoning.

208
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:30,222
Glinthawks perch there, drawn to the Spire's shining.

209
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:35,139
So, clear the machines out of two shrines and move a priest out of the other.

210
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,849
All I can ask for is your charity and that their stories are heard.

211
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,838
Namman, rituals and prayers can't bring back those who are lost.

212
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,519
No, but it can help those who grieve to find themselves.

213
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,819
It can lend them strength and hope, like a new sunrise.

214
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,465
I'll do what I can to help those in mourning.

215
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:57,680
To honour their memories is to honour us all.

216
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,939
You're not like the others.

217
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,349
You wear machine parts, but you hunted them yourself.

218
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,970
How can you tell?

219
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,069
A hunter knows a hunter.

220
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,140
My people run with the great metal herds among the northern glaciers.

221
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,359
But the Glinthawks at Sun's Climb are too strong for me.

222
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,369
So I cannot fulfil my vow to paint the story of my people there.

223
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,002
How the madness of the machines spread to the Carja,

224
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:32,359
and they sent their soldiers,
feet frost-blackened, to bring us here in chains.

225
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,680
Our Shamans, who sing the machine songs — many were taken to their deaths.

226
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,470
Their songs go unfinished in Ban-Ur.

227
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,982
Help me honour them, help me paint their story.

228
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:47,449
I ask you this, hunter to hunter.

229
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,838
You look like you've traveled far outlander.

230
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:57,139
From the Great Plains, but not alone.

231
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,480
Never alone.

232
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,460
This was a city of cages two harvest ago.

233
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,990
Wooden bars leave marks.

234
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,880
I kept those marks.

235
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,258
I can still feel the bars.

236
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:12,890
They took you as a slave but you escaped?

237
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,480
During the liberation.

238
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,558
My friend and I, they put us to work in the quarries together.

239
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:20,450
We'd grown alike, so we fled together.

240
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:24,122
But in the smoke, the trees, we ran right into the machines.

241
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:27,180
I kept running, I thought she was just behind me.

242
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,559
She is still, wherever I go, just behind me.

243
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:37,160
And that's why I came back. To finally free us from that moment.

244
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,289
But I need your help to do it.

245
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,880
I've been asking the nobles of the Sun Court to hear on my cause.

246
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,939
Just the grace of their ears.

247
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,838
You want me to shake them down too?

248
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,439
Don't tempt me.

249
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,939
I'm still a priest.

250
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,460
I need to get going.

251
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,569
May the Sun shine upon you.

252
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,660
[Carja noble]
I'll never leave Meridian, the view alone makes life worth living.

253
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,399
[Carja guard]
Always stay bright, always stay alert, that's what I say.

254
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,585
[Carja artisan]
Meridian is the centre of the world. Everyone comes here eventually.

255
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,960
[Carja guard]
 [yawns] I'm awake, and alert. Damn it.

256
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:59,319
[singing from the Sun Ring above]

257
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,140
[merchant]
Ah, you're everything I'm not, strong, brave, active.

258
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,049
[merchant]
Come, talk a spell.

259
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,028
Alright, what did you want to discuss?

260
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:30,269
You're an outlander which is good, but a Nora which might be bad.

261
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:33,891
Do you fear the ruins of the Old Ones like many in your tribe?

262
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,258
No, although some can be dangerous.

263
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:40,000
Then you may have come across what I seek.

264
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,869
In your travels have you found strange vessels
emblazoned with symbols of the Old Ones?

265
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,200
They consist of a hollow cylinder with a crescent handle affixed at both ends.

266
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,180
If you bring me these vessels in sets of four, I will gladly trade what I have for them.

267
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,439
So you are interested in the Old Ones?

268
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,400
More than interested!

269
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,359
I study every ancient artifact I can get my hands on.

270
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,538
But years of study have made me too comfortable at my desk.

271
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:13,640
I can't even bear the sun, if the truth be known.

272
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,660
I don't know how I'll manage to take a partner.

273
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,059
My family presses me for an heir.

274
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,239
Uh, don't look at me.

275
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,868
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not looking.

276
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:27,239
In fact, my father already has someone he wants me to wed.

277
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,279
She doesn't interest me.

278
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,139
I wish I had a brother to carry this burden.

279
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,450
I would rather be left to my precious little vessels.

280
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,470
What sort of ritual were these vessels made for?

281
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,970
I'm convinced they were used in conjunction with each other in sets.

282
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,639
Some people believe they were used for tea ceremonies.

283
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,358
Others think they held sacred essences and oils for worship.

284
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:56,139
But I believe they were used for the solemn custom of shaving one's beard.

285
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,639
One for water, one for lotion, and so on.

286
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:06,239
Each fluid in its special vessel
majestically applied to the face at each stage of the rite.

287
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,559
It must have been breathtaking.

288
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,989
But which vessel was used for which? I have to know!

289
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,470
I have to continue my research!

290
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,470
Are you sure people didn't just drink out of them?

291
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,960
Drink? Out of such finally crafted earthenware?

292
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,950
Don't be ridiculous!

293
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,838
I will leave you to the hunt.

294
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,200
Be sure to delve into the ruins.

295
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,838
[Carja outlander]
I like Meridian fine, but I prefer the country.

296
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,345
[Carja outlander]
Or at least I did before the machines got so bad.

297
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,318
[Carja noble]
I don't know about this ceasefire.

298
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:04,104
[Carja noble]
The Sundom prospers, Sunfall will want a piece of it eventually.

299
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,722
[Carja noble]
Who's gonna lead the Vanguard now, Erend?

300
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:12,369
[Carja noble]
The boy's a drunken wreck since the bastards got his sister.

301
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:19,196
[Carja noble]
Sun-King Avad hasn't got the stones to put an end to those traitors at Sunfall.

302
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:31,049
[Carja guard]
We all have our place in the order of things.

303
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,569
[Carja artisan]
Good day.

304
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,379
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday sun. Words to live by.

305
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:49,502
[Carja guard]
There are no shadows under the noonday sun. Words to live by.

306
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,338
Greetings Aloy.

307
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,552
I am known as Blameless Marad.

308
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,239
Please come with me.

309
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,960
You're needed for an important consultation.

310
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,238
What do you mean?

311
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,538
Where's Erend?

312
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,593
He's inside attending the Sun-King.

313
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,658
Where we should be without further delay.

314
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,480
Follow me, please.

315
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,138
[Marad]
The Sun-King is eager to meet you.

316
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,738
[Marad]
The machine tamer with a curious eye for detail.

317
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,679
[Marad]
It's all very intriguing.

318
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,428
[Aloy]
I'm not here to intrigue you.

319
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:47,760
[Marad]
Too late.

320
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,469
[Aloy]
All of these people are here to see the Sun-King?

321
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,310
[Marad]
Yes, and each has come to ask a favour of him.

322
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,532
[Marad]
Unpleasant, but that's politics.

323
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,172
[Carja noble]
First the Oseram get special treatment,
and now outlanders from the Savage East?

324
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:09,170
[Carja noble]
What possible interest could the Sun-King have in her?

325
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,048
[Carja noble]
Passed by some outlander woman? Unacceptable.

326
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:17,087
[Carja noble]
I've been here for two hours and this Nora goes to the front of the line.

327
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,628
[Marad]
Ignore them.

328
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,059
[Marad]
Nobles are like children who whine when they don't get a second helping of dessert.

329
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,358
[Aloy]
What's the Sun-King like?

330
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,460
[Marad]
The most important thing is what he isn't like — his father.

331
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,539
[Marad]
I think you'll find him to be a reasonable man.

332
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:46,460
Aloy of the Nora, she who sees the unseen. Welcome.

333
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,650
It would seem you have done me a great service.

334
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,150
Erend.

335
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:52,559
Tell her what you found.

336
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,328
I checked Ersa's tomb.

337
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,760
You were right, Aloy.

338
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,482
The body is missing a scar below her right knee.

339
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,538
I gave it to Ersa when we were kids fighting over a toy sword.

340
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,981
If the body is not Ersa's then we must assume she is still alive.

341
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,178
And I will not abandon her.

342
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,526
We only know she was taken, not who took her.

343
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,298
I can help with that.

344
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,960
Ersa has an enemy among the Oseram.

345
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,868
A warlord named Dervahl.

346
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,170
Impossible!

347
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:23,418
Every clan in The Claim has been hunting for him since the liberation.

348
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,908
He has to be dead by now.

349
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,808
No other Oseram had the motive and ingenuity to lure Ersa into this trap.

350
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,988
I expect to find him lurking somewhere near the border.

351
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,328
I've already sent an agent to investigate.

352
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,628
He'll be waiting for word from us at the market place in Pitchcliff.

353
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,860
I can't move troops to the border without provoking the Oseram.

354
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,170
But I could send a few Vanguardsmen.

355
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:48,340
And perhaps an exceptionally gifted Nora as well?

356
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,239
Erend, Marad, let me discuss it with her privately.

357
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:01,940
I hate to impose further after all you've done,
but this is a matter of great importance to me.

358
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,840
It sounds like Ersa means a lot to you.

359
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:12,260
Without her Oseram Vanguard, I would not have been able
to liberate Meridian and end my father's brutal reign.

360
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,260
Since then, it has been difficult to maintain peace between our tribes.

361
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,239
But Ersa has a way of making her people see reason.

362
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,460
So you see, I need her back at my side.

363
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,159
And quickly.

364
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,760
Why would Dervahl go to so much trouble to kidnap Ersa?

365
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,070
He felt she betrayed him.

366
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,030
She fought by his side until she realised
he planned to raze Meridian and butcher its people.

367
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,150
And she came to me.

368
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,933
Together, we stopped him and liberated the city from my father.

369
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:52,150
He truly thought of himself as a Sun God.

370
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,840
His mind was broken.

371
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:03,050
He believed that blood sacrifice would solve, well, everything.

372
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,460
So he raided the other tribes for victims, especially the Oseram.

373
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,030
Dervahl fought back.

374
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,460
He crafted powerful weapons and rallied his people.

375
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,039
My father responded with the ultimate cruelty.

376
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:25,639
He captured Dervahl's wife and daughter.

377
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,460
And sacrificed them in the Sun Ring.

378
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,218
Dervahl has spent every moment since trying to get revenge.

379
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:37,108
Your politics seem very complicated.

380
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,530
The Oseram are friends, but enemies too.

381
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:44,544
I couldn't have liberated Meridian without
the help of Ersa and her Oseram Freebooters.

382
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,840
Many of them have settled here.

383
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,940
But the ealdormen of the Oseram clans in The Claim
have become jealous of their success.

384
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,539
So have many Carja nobles.

385
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,730
It's a volatile situation, especially given the fact
that my father raided the Oseram for years.

386
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,829
Ersa helps keep the peace.

387
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,340
Promising a future based on mutual gain.

388
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,239
But some, like Dervahl, will never let go of their venom.

389
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,881
I'd like to ask you something about the Sundom and its politics.

390
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:20,308
By all means.

391
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:23,106
What can you tell me about the Shadow Carja?

392
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:25,012
What do they have to do with Ersa?

393
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:32,030
They are remnants of my father's regime,
holding out at the fortress of Sunfall to the west.

394
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,769
Like him, they care only for domination.

395
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,639
And seek to draw upon the power of the Sun by spilling blood in its name.

396
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:45,840
Since Ersa helped me take this city from them, they were perfect scapegoats.

397
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:50,272
Dervahl knew this, of course, and planned it well.

398
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:51,525
I need to get going.

399
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:52,530
I know.

400
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:57,010
Well, they say kings should never beg.

401
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,019
But please, help me find Ersa.

402
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,639
Who says that?

403
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,440
Marad, for one.

404
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:08,599
Don't hesitate to ask him or Erend if you have further questions.

405
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:38,519
[Carja guard]
It's not what I imagined when I was a boy, but it's decent work keeping the city safe.

406
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:42,449
Aloy, how can I be of service?

407
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,389
Why do they call you "Blameless Marad"?

408
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,530
Well, it depends on who you mean by "they".

409
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,820
And what "they" might wish to blame me for.

410
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:54,639
[sighs] Talking to you is tiring.

411
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,030
So they say.

412
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,269
What is it you do exactly?

413
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:00,510
Whatever is needed of course.

414
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,429
Are you always so evasive?

415
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,110
It depends.

416
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,320
You were right about Avad.

417
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,030
He seems genuine.

418
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,920
He is the Sun-King.

419
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,998
I serve him the best I can.

420
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,337
Huh, did you serve the last one as best you could too?

421
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,570
Well, I served him to his enemies.

422
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,423
It was the best I could do for the Sundom.

423
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,653
What did you do?

424
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:29,920
Nothing I could be blamed for.

425
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,006
What will I find at the border?

426
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:37,329
An outpost full of Oseram, most of whom want nothing to do with Dervahl.

427
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,719
Still, he inspires great loyalty in those who fought with him against the last Sun-King.

428
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,739
He will not be caught alone.

429
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,929
And don't forget he is a master craftsman.

430
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,798
Nothing delights him more than his dangerous toys.

431
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,940
What makes you so sure Dervahl did this to Ersa?

432
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,109
I don't care for sure or certain, I prefer likely or probably.

433
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,950
How many Oseram are clever enough for this ruse?

434
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,730
Capable of building the weapon you describe, who hate Ersa so?

435
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,530
More than one? Not likely.

436
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,300
Dervahl? Quite probably.

437
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,475
Even if people think he's dead?

438
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:25,498
That is surely another reason to be suspicious of certain words.

439
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,230
It's time for me to leave.

440
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:28,920
It would appear so.

441
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,880
[sighs] So, I thought Ersa was dead and I thought Dervahl was dead.

442
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,829
Dead doesn't seem to mean what it used to.

443
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,429
All I know is that it's time to find my sister and get some payback.

444
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,170
I hope Marad's guy grabs us a lead.

445
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,130
Did Ersa ever tell you anything about Dervahl?

446
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:57,577
We were both under his command for a while, sort of.

447
00:43:57,577 --> 00:44:00,719
Helped him recruit an army to take out the mad Sun-King.

448
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,288
But then he got real creepy with Ersa.

449
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:08,500
Needless to say, she wasn't interested but he wouldn't let it go.

450
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,738
Not to mention the fact that we realised he wanted to murder every Carja.

451
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:14,449
Not just the bad ones.

452
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,800
Long story short, he's a Grazer-licking dungbag.

453
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:23,219
Avad seems committed to finding your sister.

454
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:26,081
Yeah, those two got along.

455
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:30,210
Some people say they shacked up, but I don't buy it.

456
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:32,019
Seems a little skinny for her.

457
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,738
Okay, some bad images are forming in my head.

458
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:39,670
Let's just focus on finding her and kicking Dervahl's ass.

459
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,909
Don't stand me up in Pitchcliff, okay? Ersa needs us.

460
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:49,510

Meridian. I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
